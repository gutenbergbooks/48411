<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>In August, 1912, it was my privilege to deliver a course
of lectures at the Northfield Bible Conference. There were
many requests for the publication of the addresses. I shall
never forget the bright faces of the hundreds who gathered
in beautiful Sage Chapel at 8:30 on those August mornings.
In August, 1913, the lectures were repeated at the New
York Chautauqua and at the Winona Bible Conference.
There were renewed appeals for publication, but it was not
possible to put the material into shape because of my work
on <i>A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of
Historical Research</i>.</p>
<p>I have expanded the lectures a good deal and have added
some introductory discussion about James himself. I have
in mind ministers, social workers, students of the Bible,
Sunday school teachers, and all lovers of the Word of God
and of rightness of life. Technical matters are placed in
parentheses or in footnotes so that the reader may go on
without these if he cares to do so. There is a freshness in
the Greek text not possible in the English, but those who do
not know Greek may still read this book with entire ease.</p>
<p>I do not claim that these addresses are a detailed commentary
on the Epistle of James. They are expository talks
based, I trust, on sober, up-to-date scholarship and applied
to modern life. It is the old gospel in the new age that we
need and must know how to use. There is a wondrous charm
in these words of the long ago from one who walked so
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
close by the side of the Son of man, who misunderstood
him at first but who came at last to rejoice in his Brother
in the flesh as the Lord Jesus Christ. It is immensely worthwhile
to listen to what James has to say about Christianity
and the problems of everyday life. His words throb with
power today and strike a peculiarly modern note in the
emphasis upon social problems and reality in religion. They
have the breath of heaven and the warmth of human sympathy
and love. Except for a few quotations from the King
James Version, Scripture quotations follow the American
Standard Version.</p>
<h2>Preface to Second Edition</h2>
<p>The welcome accorded this interpretation of the Epistle
of James makes a new edition necessary. Opportunity is
thus afforded for weeding out misprints. Prof. S. L. Watson,
of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has kindly verified all the references
in the book. The words of James strike a peculiarly
modern note during these days of war.</p>

<br />James, a Servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<h3>The Brother of the Lord</h3>
<p>It will be well to put together the bits of information about
James, or Jacob,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> as he is called in the Greek. They are not
very numerous, and yet it is possible to form a reasonably
clear picture of his personality.</p>
<p>It is here assumed that James the author of the epistle is
James the brother of the Lord (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 1:19</span>). It is hardly conceivable
that James the brother of John could have written
the epistle, since he was put to death as early as <span class="small">A.D.</span> 44 by
Herod Agrippa I (<span class="scripRef">Acts 12:2</span>). The matters presented in the
epistle were hardly acute in the Jewish Christian world by
that date, and there is no evidence that this James had attained
a special position of leadership that justified a general
appeal to Jewish Christians.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The epistle belongs to the five &ldquo;disputed&rdquo; epistles (James,
Jude, 2 and 3 John, 2 Peter) and it circulated in the East before
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
it did in the West. It occurs in the Peshitta Syriac Version.
Origen (in Johan. xix. 6) knows it as &ldquo;the Epistle current
as that of James&rdquo; and Eusebius (H. E. III. xxv. 3) describes
it with the other four as &ldquo;nevertheless well-known to
most people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many proofs<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> that the epistle was written by the
author of the speech in <span class="scripRef">Acts 15:13-21</span>&mdash;delicate similarities
of thought and style too subtle for mere imitation or copying.
The same likeness appears between the Epistle of James and
the letter to Antioch, probably written also by James
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:23-29</span>). There are, besides, apparent reminiscences of the
Sermon on the Mount, which James may have heard personally
or at least heard the substance of it. There is the
same vividness of imagery in the epistle that is so prominent
a characteristic of the teaching of Jesus.</p>
<p>If it be urged that the author of the epistle, if related to
Jesus, would have said so, one may reply that a delicate
sense of propriety may have had precisely the opposite effect.
Jesus had himself laid emphasis on the fact of his spiritual
kinship with all believers as more important
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:48-50</span>). The fact that James during the ministry of Jesus
was not sympathetic with His work would also act as a restraining
force upon him. The brother of Jesus (see also
<span class="scripRef">Jude 1</span>) naturally would wish to make his appeal on the same
plane as the other teachers of the gospel. He rejoices in the
title of &ldquo;servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; just as
Paul did later (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 1:1</span>; <span class="scripRef">Phil. 1:1</span>; <span class="scripRef">Titus 1:1</span>) and as Jude,
the brother of James, did (<span class="scripRef">Jude 1</span>).</p>
<p>Paul, however, added the term &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">Romans 1:1</span>
and <span class="scripRef">Titus 1:1</span> which James and Jude do not employ. None of
them were members of the twelve, although Paul claimed
apostleship on a par with the twelve (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 9:1 f.; 15:8;</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 12:11 f.</span>). And yet Paul implies (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 1:19</span>) that
James also is an apostle<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> in a true sense of that term. Like
Paul, he had seen the risen Lord (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 15:7</span>). But James,
though one of the pillars at Jerusalem with Peter and John
(<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:9</span>), is content with the humbler word &ldquo;slave.&rdquo; He is
the bondsman of the Lord Jesus Christ as well as of God and
so is a Christian in the full sense of the term.</p>
<p>He places Jesus on a par with God and uses Christ as a
part of the name. He identifies his brother Jesus with the Messiah
of the Old Testament and the fulfilment of the hopes and
aspirations of true Judaism. One must perceive that the term
&ldquo;Christ&rdquo; in the mouth of James carries its full content and is
used deliberately. He adds also &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; which has here
the Old Testament connotation of worship. It is not a mere
polite term for station or courtesy. The use of &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; by the
side of &ldquo;God&rdquo; places James unquestionably in the ranks of
worshipers of Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. See also
<span class="scripRef">James 2:1</span>, &ldquo;faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I consider it settled that James was not the cousin of Jesus,
the son of the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus. There is no
doubt that the Greek word for brother is used for members
of a brotherhood in the current Greek of the first century
<span class="small">A.D.</span>, just as we find it so frequently in the New Testament.
This usage does not apply to the brothers of Jesus referred to
in the Gospels (<span class="scripRef">John 2:12</span>; <span class="scripRef">Mark 6:3</span>; <span class="scripRef">Matt. 13:55</span>; <span class="scripRef">John 7:3</span>).
In <span class="scripRef">Matthew 12:46, 49</span> we find both the literal and the figurative
use of &ldquo;brother&rdquo; side by side. In this looser sense anyone
may be called &ldquo;brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">Leviticus 10:4</span> the first cousins of Aaron are termed
&ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; but this instance does not justify the constant use
of the word in the Gospels for a definite group of persons as
brothers of Jesus if they were only cousins. Besides, they appear
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
constantly with Mary, the mother of Jesus, as members
of her family. The use of &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; increases the argument for
the common use of the word (<span class="scripRef">Mark 6:3</span>; <span class="scripRef">Matt. 13:56</span>). There
are many other difficulties in the way of this position, such as
the fact of two sisters with the name of Mary and the identification
of Alphaeus and Clopas.</p>
<p>The theory that James and the other brothers and sisters
were all children of Joseph by a former marriage (step-brother
theory) is free from the difficulty about the word
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; and is not inconceivable in itself. Unfortunately
there are critical objections to it, for Jesus is not called &ldquo;only
begotten&rdquo; of Mary but &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">Luke 2:7</span>: &ldquo;She brought
forth her firstborn son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus is &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; of God (<span class="scripRef">John 1:18</span>), as the widow
of Nain had an only son (<span class="scripRef">Luke 7:12</span>) and Jairus an only
daughter (<span class="scripRef">Luke 8:42</span>). But &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; occurs in the true
sense all through the Septuagint (cf. <span class="scripRef">Gen. 27:19, 32; 43:33</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Deut. 21:15</span>), where there were other children. The inscriptions
show it in the true sense. The New Testament instances
of &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; are all strictly correct from this standpoint,
even <span class="scripRef">Colossians 1:15</span> and <span class="scripRef">Romans 8:29</span>. &ldquo;Firstborn&rdquo; implies
other children. Besides, the natural meaning of <span class="scripRef">Matthew 1:25</span> leads to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>The theory (brother or half-brother theory) that Jesus
and James were sons of the same mother, Mary, may be said
to hold the field against the others. In fact, it is most likely
that both of the other theories grew out of the desire to secure
a greater imaginary sanctity for Mary under the impression
that she was more holy if she bore only Jesus and did not
live as wife with Joseph. But this is contrary to all Jewish
sentiment, and certainly there is nothing in the Gospels to
countenance this notion but much to contradict it. We conclude,
therefore, that James, the author of the epistle, is the
brother of Jesus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h3>In the Family Circle at Nazareth</h3>
<p>In spite of Origen&rsquo;s opinion (Origen on <span class="scripRef">Matt. 13:55</span>) that
the sons and daughters of Joseph were children of a former
marriage, an opinion more than offset by the position of
Tertullian (<i>de Monog. 8</i>, <i>de Virg. Vel. 6</i>), we must think of
the family circle at Nazareth as composed of five brothers
(Jesus, James, Joses, Judas, Simon, as in <span class="scripRef">Mark 6:3</span>, but Jesus,
James, Joseph, Simon, Judas in <span class="scripRef">Matt. 13:55</span>) and the &ldquo;sisters.&rdquo;
Every implication is that they all passed as sons and daughters
of Joseph and Mary in the usual sense. The order implies
also that while Jesus was the eldest, James came next
among the brothers. Unfortunately, the names of the sisters
are not given.</p>
<p>We are to think, therefore, of a large home circle in the
humble carpenter&rsquo;s house in Nazareth. Jesus, the eldest, followed
the trade of Joseph, the father of the family, and came
to be known as &ldquo;the carpenter&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 6:3</span>). Certainly all the
children must have learned to work with their hands, although
we do not know whether James adopted that trade or
some other. He would soon be called upon to help in the support
of the family, as Joseph seems to be dead when Jesus
enters upon his ministry; he is not mentioned with Mary and
the children in <span class="scripRef">Matthew 13:55</span> and <span class="scripRef">Mark 6:3</span>. Joseph was
probably older than Mary. The family were not peasants,
and they probably had all the necessary comforts of the simple
primitive life of a workman in a small town in Galilee.</p>
<p>Jewish boys usually started to school when six years old,
but before that the education of James had begun in the
home. &ldquo;James, together with his brothers and sisters, was
brought up in an atmosphere charged with reverence for God
and love for man, with tenderness, freedom, and joy.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> The
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Jewish parents did not shirk parental responsibility for the
religious training of the children, and a large family was regarded
as a blessing from God. The love of God was the first
of all lessons taught at home, and this was followed by the
simple elements of truth, uprightness, mercy, and beneficence.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
The Jewish mother rejoiced in her children, and
James was fortunate in having such a mother as Mary and
such a father as Joseph, whose dedication to the things of
their God was sincere.</p>
<p>At school, while religion was the main theme and portions
of the Old Testament the textbook, there was abundant intellectual
stimulus. The quick-witted boy would be all alive
to the great problems of faith and duty. The teacher would
probably use the Aramaic dialect of Galilee, even if he had
the Old Testament in Hebrew. But the boy would soon learn
to speak the <i>Koine</i> also, the current Greek of the world, the
language of commerce and of common intercourse everywhere.
Simon Peter, the fisherman, knew and used Greek, as
did John, the apostle. It was common for people to know two
languages. Paul probably knew Aramaic and Hebrew, Greek
and Latin. Jesus knew and spoke both Aramaic and Greek
and probably knew Hebrew also.</p>
<p>James came to write Greek with a great deal of ease and
skill. He was in no sense a litt&eacute;rateur. He was no Atticist in
his style and did not try to imitate the classical Greek writers,
whom he probably never read. Deissmann<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> does call the
Epistle of James &ldquo;a little piece of literature,&rdquo; but he means a
product of popular literature. Certainly there is nothing artificial
in content and style. Is it mere fancy to think that the
same poetic beauty shown in Mary&rsquo;s Magnificat (<span class="scripRef">Luke 1:46-55</span>)
appears in the Sermon on the Mount and in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Epistle of James? At least the rich acquaintance with the
Old Testament exists in all three.</p>
<p>The author of the epistle is gifted with imagination and
shows knowledge of the apocryphal books, especially the
wisdom literature of the Jews. But he is a thorough Jew in his
outlook and literary method,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> so much so indeed that it is
contended by some that James wrote the epistle originally in
Aramaic,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> an unlikely supposition. The widespread diffusion
of Greek in Palestine amply accounts for the author&rsquo;s grasp
of the language.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> The epigrammatic and picturesque style is
due to the writer&rsquo;s individuality, his environment, and his
reading. His vocabulary is rich in words about fishing, husbandry,
and domestic life, as one would expect.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> A man of
the force and position of James could easily broaden his acquaintance
with the Greek tongue as the years went by. The
Greek is pure <i>Koine</i>, with few Hebraisms, though the tone is
distinctly that of the Old Testament.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> He speaks like a
prophet of old in the service of Christ. There is no doubt that
James came to be a man of culture in a real sense.</p>
<p>He probably married early, as it was the custom of the
Jews for men to marry at the age of eighteen.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> Paul expressly
states that the brothers of the Lord were married (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 9:5</span>).
We do not know, of course, the age of James when
Jesus began his ministry. In all probability he had already
married and had a home of his own in Nazareth. The sisters
probably married and settled in Nazareth also (<span class="scripRef">Mark 6:3</span>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>We have no mention of the rest of the children going to
Jerusalem when the boy Jesus was taken (<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:41-52</span>). Indeed,
it is rather implied that they were not in the company,
but this does not mean that James did not have his turn to go
at the age of twelve and afterward.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that James grew up to be a
Nazarite, as Hegesippus quoted by Eusebius (H. E. ii. 23)
alleges: &ldquo;He is distinguished from others of the same name
by the title &lsquo;Just,&rsquo; which has been applied to him from the
first. He was holy from his mother&rsquo;s womb, drank no wine or
strong drink, nor ate animal food; no razor came on his head,
nor did he anoint himself with oil nor use the bath. To him
only was it permitted to enter the Holy of Holies.&rdquo; The evident
legendary details here deprive the statement of real
value except as witness to his genuine piety and to the esteem
in which he was held by the people generally. Hegesippus
adds: &ldquo;His knees became hard like a camel&rsquo;s, because he was
always kneeling in the temple, asking forgiveness for the people,&rdquo;
a description of his life in Jerusalem after he became a
Christian. At any rate, like Joseph his father, he grew up to
be a just man and came to be known as James the Just.</p>
<h3>A Scoffer of Jesus</h3>
<p>We are left to conjecture what the brothers and sisters of
Jesus thought when he went down to the Jordan to meet the
Baptist. We know that &ldquo;Mary kept all these sayings, pondering
them in her heart&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:19</span>). Mary had seen the
dawning messianic consciousness when Jesus was only
twelve (<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:49</span>). The reply of Jesus to his mother&rsquo;s hint
about the wine at the wedding of Cana implies that they had
talked over his messianic task (<span class="scripRef">John 2:4</span>). But the brothers
accompanied Jesus, his mother, and the small band of six
disciples to Capernaum after the miracle at Cana, and the
group remained together for some days (<span class="scripRef">John 2:12</span>). They
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
may have met at Nazareth after the wedding at Cana and
thence proceeded to Capernaum.</p>
<p>It is possible that the brothers, not being at Cana and not
knowing the secret between Jesus and Mary, may not have
grasped the significance of the events connected with the
baptism of Jesus and his entrance upon his messianic career.
The presence of the band of &ldquo;disciples&rdquo; (learners at the feet
of the new Rabbi) argues that the brothers must have known
something about the wonderful claims of Jesus, their brother.
At any rate, it is pleasant to see them all here together in
Capernaum in fellowship and friendliness, &ldquo;a proof of the
closeness of the ties uniting our Lord and them. No shadow
of estrangement had as yet fallen upon their relations.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
Godet thinks that Mary and the brothers came on to Capernaum,
eager for more miracles like the one at Cana, and
may have been keenly disappointed because Jesus wrought
none. This is possible but hardly as probable as the idea that
it was a friendly group in frank fellowship in Capernaum.</p>
<p>We are left in the dark as to the real attitude of the brothers
of Jesus when he began his great work. They may have
looked upon him as a sort of irregular rabbi or a mild enthusiast
carried away by the new teaching of John the Baptist.
There would be natural pride in his work while it succeeded,
without necessary belief in his claims. Certainly
Mary must have had at first the utmost faith, tremulous with
expectation, in the messiahship of Jesus. Perhaps the brothers
were at first only mildly interested or even skeptical of the
qualifications of one out of their own family circle. The brothers
may not have been free from the jealousy sometimes
seen in home life.</p>
<p>It was not long before hostility toward Jesus sprang up in
Nazareth itself, according to the vivid narrative in <span class="scripRef">Luke 4:16-31</span>;
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
it probably was soon after the return of Jesus from
Judea and Samaria to Galilee, certainly after the miracle at
Capernaum (<span class="scripRef">Luke 4:23</span>), as told in <span class="scripRef">John 4:46-54</span>. James may
have shared with the rest the first wonder at the words of
grace (<span class="scripRef">Luke 4:22</span>) and the quick flash of wrath as the pride
of the town was pricked (<span class="scripRef">Luke 4:28</span>). Henceforth in Nazareth,
despite his growing fame elsewhere, Jesus was <i>persona
non grata</i>. His brothers felt this atmosphere of hostility very
keenly.</p>
<p>The curtain falls on the family life in Nazareth till toward
the close of the Galilean ministry, after the second general
tour of Galilee by Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Luke 8:1-3</span>). The tremendous work
of Jesus had created a wonderful impression. The multitudes
in amazement asked if Jesus were not the son of David, the
Messiah (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:23</span>). The Pharisees in anger and chagrin
replied that he was in league with Beelzebub (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:24</span>).
The excitement was intense. Jesus could not eat
(<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:20</span>). News of all this came to &ldquo;his friends&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:21</span>),
who are explained in <span class="scripRef">Mark 3:31</span> as &ldquo;his mother and his
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably already vague rumors were afloat that Jesus was
out of his head. Once people said of Jesus that he was &ldquo;a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 7:34</span>), but now he
is so queer! In the inner circle at Nazareth Mary had
watched and heard it all. What could it mean? Perhaps,
Mary argued, his reason has been temporarily dethroned by
the strain and the excitement. She will go and bring him
home where he can have quiet and rest. It was easier for the
brothers to see it so, since they had not accepted him as
Messiah. Perhaps one may have said, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; At any
rate, &ldquo;they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is
beside himself&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:21</span>).</p>
<p>Jesus is in a crowded house in Galilee near the lake when
they come (<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:19</span>) and readily understands why they
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
have come when he is told that his mother and brothers are
standing without and wish to speak with him (<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:31</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:46</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 8:19 f.</span>). It is a tragedy of life, pathetic
beyond words. The ecclesiastics have long ago made issue
with him and are now violently assailing him. Many of the
people are following the lead of the Pharisees. And now his
own mother and brothers have come and wish to take him
home so as to avoid the scandal and shame of his further
public ministry. The Pharisees say he has a demon and is in
league with the devil. The &ldquo;charitable&rdquo; construction, therefore,
is that he is a lunatic. But Jesus does not go out to meet
his own mother and brothers (James among them). He had
come to know one of the bitterest of human sorrows, a pang
to the very heart&mdash;to be misunderstood &ldquo;among his own kin,
and in his own house&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 6:4</span>).</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that Jesus found consolation
in the fact that many did understand him. &ldquo;And looking
round on them that sat round about him&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:34</span>) when
the message came, &ldquo;he stretched forth his hand towards his
disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren! For
whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he
is my brother, and sister, and mother&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:49 f.</span>).
Mother and brothers and even his &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; (note &ldquo;and sister&rdquo;)
had failed in the crisis to comprehend Jesus. But the
Father in heaven had not veiled his face from Jesus. It is not
clear that James heard this pathetic rebuke from Jesus, as he
may have remained standing outside the house. Many have
come into spiritual fellowship with Jesus who thus have the
peculiar privilege of taking the place made empty in his
heart for the time by mother and sister and brother. With
Mary it was a temporary eclipse, and she was loyal at the end
as she stood by the cross (<span class="scripRef">John 19:25</span>).</p>
<p>Jesus made another and a last visit to Nazareth (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 13:54-58</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Mark 6:1-6</span>). There was a revival of interest in him
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
which crystallized into hard skepticism, so that Jesus &ldquo;did
not many mighty works there,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;marvelled because
of their unbelief.&rdquo; He was a &ldquo;prophet without honor&rdquo;
in Nazareth as he left for the last time the city of his childhood
and early manhood.</p>
<p>The tide at last turned against Jesus in Capernaum (<span class="scripRef">John 6:22-71</span>)
and in Galilee generally. For six months he remained
away, save for a brief visit that met with the united
hostility of Pharisee and Sadducee (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 15:39 to 16:4</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Mark 8:10-13</span>). The brothers of Jesus meanwhile seemed to
grow in this spirit of dislike toward the elder brother. Six
months before the death of Jesus they ridiculed him for his
being a virtual refugee from Galilee and for his secretive
methods, quite inconsistent with his claims of messiahship
(<span class="scripRef">John 7:2-5</span>). James as the oldest of the brothers was probably
the spokesman on this occasion. The &ldquo;advice&rdquo; was of an
extremely irritating nature, with the implication that Jesus
was seeking to gain credit &ldquo;in public&rdquo; while doing his work
&ldquo;in secret.&rdquo; It is not surprising, therefore, that Jesus did precisely
the opposite, for he went up to Jerusalem, &ldquo;not publicly,
but as it were in secret&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">John 7:10</span>).</p>
<p>John explains the motive of the brothers (<span class="scripRef">7:4 f.</span>), &ldquo;for even
his brethren did not believe on him.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> They had reached the
point when they were willing to attack Jesus. They belonged
to the world and did not understand Jesus (<span class="scripRef">John 7:6 f.</span>). It
is not necessary to say that James was actually a Pharisee,
still less an Essene. The use made of his name by the Judaizers
in the controversy with Paul does not prove this to be
true (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:12</span>). But certainly he was now in general sympathy
with the hostile attitude of the ecclesiastics from Jerusalem
(both Pharisee and Sadducee). The cup that Jesus
must drink at Jerusalem has this added bitterness in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>It is not particularly surprising, when all things are considered,
that at his death Jesus commended his mother to
John, the beloved disciple, rather than to any of his brothers
or sisters. They were all completely out of sympathy with
him and with her. At such an hour sympathy counted far
more than blood relationship alone. Besides, the brothers
may not have been in Jerusalem at this time, for they still
lived in Nazareth. It is possible, of course, that James may
have been at the Passover, which was so generally attended
by the Jews. Certainly he was at Pentecost later (<span class="scripRef">Acts 1:14</span>).</p>
<p>We do not know whether Jesus appeared to James in Jerusalem
or in Galilee (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 15:7</span>), though Paul mentions it
after the appearance to the more than five hundred, which
was in Galilee. Mary needed immediate attention, and Jesus
died upon the cross with James and all his brothers and sisters
utterly out of touch with him. &ldquo;Doubtless their very intimacy
with our Lord blinded them to his real greatness.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<h3>Seeing the Risen Christ</h3>
<p>It is Paul who tells us of this most interesting event (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 15:7</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> As already stated, we do not know where James was
when the risen Jesus manifested himself to him. Broadus<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
locates the event in Jerusalem after the return from Galilee
and before the ascension. As a matter of fact, it could have
been in Galilee perfectly well. James may have come to Jerusalem
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 1:14</span>) because he had been converted in Galilee.
At any rate, &ldquo;this appearance to James is the only one not
made to a known believer.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> But Dale<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> holds that James
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
had already been converted before his Brother appeared to
him as a result of information from his mother or from the
apostles. This is, of course, possible, but it cannot be insisted
on as necessary on the ground that Jesus appeared to believers
only. The case of Saul refutes that position.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that James may have heard of the report
of the resurrection of Jesus and had thus some preparation
for the great event when he saw Jesus risen from the dead.
We are told nothing of what passed between the two brothers,
but one may be sure that no harsh reproof came from
Jesus for the indifference and even scoffing of James. The
brothers of Jesus were children of their age, which was a
pharisaic age in Palestine. The current expectation was for
a political Messiah, not a Saviour dying for the sins of the
world.</p>
<p>Even the twelve apostles had not risen to the conception of
a spiritual Messiah, and they had given up all hope upon the
death of Jesus and had to be convinced themselves of the
fact of the resurrection of Jesus, a task of much difficulty,
particularly in the case of Thomas, though they all at first
scoffed at the stories of Mary Magdalene and the other
women. So, then, the path of James toward faith was not an
easy one, but he took it and came out boldly on the side of
the disciples of Christ. It is more than likely that it was
through James that the other three brothers were led to faith
in Jesus as Lord and Saviour (<span class="scripRef">Acts 1:14</span>).</p>
<p><i>The Gospel of the Hebrews</i> as quoted by Jerome (<i>de Viris
Illustribus 2</i>) gives a story to the effect that James was already
a disciple and present at the last Passover with Jesus
and took a vow &ldquo;that he would not eat bread from that hour
on which he had drunk the cup of the Lord till he saw him
risen from the dead. Again, a little afterward, the Lord says,
Bring a table and bread. Immediately it is added: He took
bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave it to James the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Just, and said to him, My brother, eat the bread; for the Son
of Man has risen from the dead.&rdquo; Mayor<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> is inclined to
credit this story in part, but surely it utterly misunderstands
<span class="scripRef">Luke 22:18</span>, makes James one of the twelve, and is impossible
from any point of view, since not even the twelve expected
Jesus to rise from the dead.</p>
<p>There are difficulties enough connected with the proof of
the resurrection of Jesus without burdening the narrative
with this story. But, let me add, modern science has not
made faith in the resurrection of Jesus impossible, nor has
modern research disposed of the value of the Gospel accounts
of this tremendous event. Paul, who testifies to this
experience of James, is himself the chief witness to the reality
of the fact. This is not the place to enter upon a discussion of
this great question, but modern men may and do still believe
in the risen Christ with all simplicity and sincerity.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<h3>In the Upper Room at Pentecost</h3>
<p>The simple statement in <span class="scripRef">Acts 1:14</span> is: &ldquo;These all ... continued
stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the
mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.&rdquo; So then all four are
now disciples and are admitted to the inmost secrets of the
circle of believers in Jerusalem, whither they have now come.
Certainly, now that they have all come to believe in their
Brother as in reality the Messiah of Israel risen from the dead,
they must come to Jerusalem to be with their mother in her
hour of triumph and joy. No one but a mother can understand
the fulness of satisfaction in Mary&rsquo;s heart now. The
sword had pierced her own soul (<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:35</span>), as old Simeon
had prophesied when he saw the Babe in the Temple, but
now the wound has been healed and there is a new and richer
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Magnificat in her heart. It was worth all that she had endured
to wait with the disciples and her other sons in the upper
room for the Promise of the Father. The breach in her
family life had been healed.</p>
<p>It is clear that the heartiest of welcomes greeted the brothers
of Jesus. They were men of importance in themselves,
James in particular, who from every standpoint is one of the
first men of his day. It is possible that the coolness of James
and the other brothers had injured the work of Jesus with a
good many, who used this fact against the claims of Jesus.
Now the accession of these brothers was of the utmost value
to the band of believers gathered in the upper room, where
Jesus had manifested himself before his ascension.</p>
<p>The presence of the brothers is mentioned by Luke before
the choice of Matthias to succeed Judas. One may naturally
wonder why James was not suggested by Peter, since he undoubtedly
was equal to the eleven in ability and all other
qualities save one. But this one defect was fatal. He had not
been with the twelve during the ministry of Jesus and so
could not be a firsthand witness to his words and teachings
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 1:22</span>). Otherwise, we may infer that James would have
been a welcome addition to the twelve in the place of Judas.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>But the significant fact is that James is present during the
wonderful days of this Pentecost and is filled, like the rest,
with the Holy Spirit. He enters upon the new task of world
evangelization with the new insight and the new influx of divine
power. He faces the new day with the light of the sun in
his face.</p>
<h3>Leadership in the Jerusalem Church</h3>
<p>If he was disqualified from being one of the twelve, he was
not debarred from liberty to serve. In fact, he was a practical
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
apostle in Jerusalem along with the rest. The twelve kept no
secrets from James. He gradually won his way to the love and
confidence of all the great church in Jerusalem. His importance
in Jerusalem is recognized by Paul on the occasion of
his visit to Jerusalem on his return from Damascus, for he
says: &ldquo;Other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord&rsquo;s
brother&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 1:19</span>). Here Paul treats him as an apostle and
practically calls him so.</p>
<p>James had probably seen Paul before, when he was the
leader of the persecution against the Christians. He doubtless
was glad to see this powerful addition to the forces of
Christianity, but James is probably included in Luke&rsquo;s statement
of the reception of Paul on this occasion. &ldquo;And they
were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 9:26</span>). Barnabas alone had faith in Paul and the courage
to stand by him. If James was suspicious of the new convert,
so were all the rest, and not without reason. It is clear
from Paul&rsquo;s reference in <span class="scripRef">Galatians 1:18</span> that Peter responded
heartily to Paul&rsquo;s advances after once opening his heart to
him. They had a delightful fifteen days together. It is not
likely, as Farrar<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> argues, that James, being a legalist, held
aloof from Paul throughout. This is wholly gratuitous.</p>
<p>James is not mentioned again in Acts till <span class="scripRef">12:17</span>, and in a
most significant manner. James, the brother of John, has been
killed by Herod Agrippa I. Peter has been thrown into prison
but has been released by the angel of the Lord in response to
the prayers of the church assembled in the home of Mary,
mother of John Mark (<span class="scripRef">12:12</span>). Peter goes to the house and
tells the astonished group: &ldquo;Tell these things unto James, and
to the brethren.&rdquo; This is somewhere about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 44. James now
clearly occupies a position of leadership in the church. Peter
himself apparently leaves the city for the time being (<span class="scripRef">12:17</span>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
There are already &ldquo;elders&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">11:30</span>) in the church at Jerusalem.
We do not know what the position of James is, but certainly
it is one of great honor and leadership. The apostles,
since James could not be one of the twelve who were charged
with the general work of evangelization, may have been glad
for James to be in charge at Jerusalem. Certainly he proved
himself fully equal to the task.</p>
<p>James maintains the position of leadership in Jerusalem
throughout the narrative in Acts. He is evidently the president
of the Jerusalem Conference (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:14-21</span>). He is in
charge of the church when Paul visits Jerusalem the last time
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 21:18</span>): &ldquo;Paul went in with us unto James; and all the
elders were present.&rdquo; He possessed the confidence of this
great Jewish church, the mother church at Jerusalem, and
had the ear of the non-Christian Jewish world in a way
hardly true of any other disciple of Jesus. Jews would listen
to James who would not heed Simon Peter.</p>
<h3>The Writing of the Epistle</h3>
<p>The Epistle of James probably was written shortly before
the Jerusalem Conference, most likely just before, that is,
about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 48 or 49. There is no room here for an extended
discussion of the proof of this statement. In general I agree
with the arguments of Mayor on this point.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> Plummer<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> is unable
to decide between <span class="small">A.D.</span> 49 and 59. Writers like von
Soden place it at the end of the century, and Bruckner puts it
in the second century. Spitta admits that Paul in Romans alludes
to the Epistle of James, but suggests that the present
epistle is a Christian adaptation of a Jewish book.</p>
<p>On the whole, the weight of the argument is toward the
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
conclusion that James wrote the epistle before the Conference
and without reference to the Judaizing controversy.
Paul in Galatians and Romans may very well have in mind a
misuse of what James in <span class="scripRef">chapter 2</span> says about faith and
works, which misapprehension he seeks to correct. The epistle
must be placed either between <span class="small">A.D.</span> 40 and 50, before the
Judaizing controversy arose, or in the middle of the second
century, after it had died down.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> The early date has the best
of it, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If this date for the writing of the epistle is correct, we have
no difficulty in seeing how James could have written it so
early. Already about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 44 we saw his leadership in the Jerusalem
church (<span class="scripRef">Acts 12:17</span>). No man in the apostolic circles
at this period had the ear of the Jewish Christians as did
James. This is seen further in the fact that he is asked to preside
over the Conference in Jerusalem to settle the issues
raised by the Judaizers against the work of Paul and Barnabas
among the Gentiles. The epistle, therefore, seems to come
in at this state of the career of James and is the chief expression
left of his mind and life.</p>
<h3>Champion of Paul at the Conference</h3>
<p>I cannot enter upon a formal discussion of the many questions
in dispute concerning this great event in the apostolic
period. I can only briefly sketch my own interpretation of the
part played by James on this occasion.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> In brief, it is here
maintained that in <span class="scripRef">Galatians 2:1-10</span> Paul gives a report of the
private interview with the leaders in Jerusalem after the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
public meeting (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:3 f.</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:2</span>) was adjourned because
of the violent opposition of the Judaizers (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:5</span>).
In this private conference Paul, though anxious to win the
public support of James and Cephas and John, &ldquo;the reputed
pillars&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:9</span>), yet was not willing to compromise the
great issue at stake, &ldquo;our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">2:4</span>) and &ldquo;the truth of the gospel&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2:5</span>).</p>
<p>Paul reveals a certain amount of embarrassment in his references
to the three great leaders in Jerusalem, as is manifest
in the long and broken sentence in <span class="scripRef">verses 6-10</span>. He roundly
asserts his independence of them and affirms that they imparted
nothing to him (<span class="scripRef">2:6</span>). It seems clear that some of the
more timid brethren were quite disposed to surrender to the
Judaizers for the sake of peace and in particular to agree that
Titus, a full-fledged Greek convert in Paul&rsquo;s company, should
be circumcised. But Paul gave &ldquo;the pillars&rdquo; to understand
that he would not have peace on those terms. It is quite possible
that James, here mentioned before Cephas (Peter) and
John as the real leader of the group,<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> had not till now clearly
understood Paul&rsquo;s true position.</p>
<p>The Judaizers had in all probability counted on James to
take their side against Paul, &ldquo;but contrariwise, when they
saw<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> that I had been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision,
even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision
... they ... gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they
unto the circumcision&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2:7-9</span>). It is much easier to think of
James as the author of <span class="scripRef">chapter 2</span> in his epistle before this
event than after this pact with Paul. Note also in
<span class="scripRef">verse 9</span>,
&ldquo;and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me....&rdquo;
Now the coast is clear, and Paul is sure of victory in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
open Conference. The stipulation about the poor (<span class="scripRef">2:10</span>) was
in harmony with Paul&rsquo;s previous practice (<span class="scripRef">Acts 11:29 f.</span>).</p>
<p>In the second meeting of the general Conference James
evidently presides and sums up the situation in favor of Paul,
after Peter (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:7-12</span>) has shown how they had already
agreed to Gentile liberty in the case of Cornelius and his
household. James, with due deliberation (<span class="scripRef">15:13</span>), concludes
(<span class="scripRef">15:12-21</span>) with a pointed endorsement of Simon Peter&rsquo;s
speech and acceptance of the work at Caesarea and among
the Gentiles generally as a visitation of God. He clinches the
whole matter by showing that the prophets (as <span class="scripRef">Amos 9:11 f.</span>)
agree with this position that the Gentiles are to be saved.
&ldquo;Wherefore my judgment is,&rdquo; he says as the president of the
Conference, practically offering a resolution for the vote of
the Conference, &ldquo;that we trouble not them that from among
the Gentiles turn to God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:19</span>). He has put the matter
in a very happy form. Surely Jewish Christians could but
rejoice to see Gentiles &ldquo;turn to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James proposes the writing of an epistle to the Gentile
Christians to this effect, with the added warning &ldquo;that they
abstain from the pollution of idols, and from fornication, and
from what is strangled, and from blood.&rdquo; It is at least open to
question whether &ldquo;what is strangled&rdquo; is genuine here, since it
is wanting in D (Codex Bezae), Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian, and
Cyprian, as also in <span class="scripRef">15:28</span>. If so, the prohibition is against idolatry
(idol feasts), murder (blood), and immorality (fornication),
the great vices of heathenism. But with the text as it
stands, &ldquo;things strangled,&rdquo; we seem to have a concession to
the Jewish ceremonial law and to Jewish prejudices on that
point. James is not uneasy about Moses, for he is read in the
synagogues every sabbath (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:21</span>), a reference to the
habit of the Christians still to worship in the Jewish synagogues
(cf. <span class="scripRef">James 2:2</span>).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; of James is manifest in this masterly address,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
which held conviction to such an extent that the resolution
of James was carried unanimously by the body of &ldquo;the
apostles and the elders, with the whole church&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:22</span>),
a remarkable outcome when the bitterness of the Judaizers is
considered and a distinct tribute to the influence of James.
We may assume that the Judaizers were silent, since they
saw that they were hopelessly defeated.</p>
<p>The epistle which was sent to the church at Antioch
(<span class="scripRef">15:23-29</span>) embodies the ideas of James and was probably
written by him, since the style is like that of his speech and
the epistle that bears his name. The letter expressly disclaims
responsibility for the conduct of the Judaizers at Antioch
(<span class="scripRef">15:24</span>), pointedly condemns their behavior, commends &ldquo;our
beloved Barnabas and Paul&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">vv. 25 f.</span>),
refers to the messengers
Judas and Silas, claims the guidance of the Holy Spirit
in the stand for Gentile freedom (<span class="scripRef">v. 28</span>), and repeats the
stipulations in the speech of James about the special Gentile
sins (<span class="scripRef">v. 29</span>).</p>
<p>There can be no question that James here entered fully into
sympathy with the contention of Paul that the yoke of Jewish
ceremonialism should not be imposed upon the Gentile
Christians. James is a champion of the Pauline doctrine of
grace as opposed to works. It is interesting to note the phrase
&ldquo;the perfect law of liberty&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">James 1:25</span>). It is difficult to see
how, after this Conference, James and Paul could misunderstand
or oppose each other. As we shall see, the real explanation
of the apparent conflict between <span class="scripRef">James 2</span> and <span class="scripRef">Romans 3</span>
is quite other than this unnecessary hypothesis. James has
now given the great weight of his character and influence
among the Jewish Christians to the endorsement of the work
of Paul among the Gentiles. James is a Jewish Christian but
not a Judaizer. He does not wish to impose the burden of the
Mosaic ritual upon the Gentiles, though he still observes it
himself, as do the other Jewish Christians, including Paul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h3>Misuse of the Name of James</h3>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">Galatians 2:11</span> Paul speaks of a visit of Peter to Antioch,
apparently some time after the events recorded in <span class="scripRef">2:1-10</span>. If
it were before the Conference, Peter&rsquo;s conduct at Antioch
would be largely relieved of the charge of cowardice. But on
the whole, we must follow the order of time as given by Paul.
We do not, however, know whether this visit of Peter was before
the breach between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:36-41</span>) or after the return of Paul from the second
tour (<span class="scripRef">Acts 18:22 f.</span>). If the latter is true, Barnabas had also
come back to Antioch (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:13</span>). Patrick<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> thinks that this
visit was not long after the Conference, probably before the
breach with Barnabas. At any rate, Peter at Antioch practices
social equality with the Gentiles, just as Paul and Barnabas
and the rest of the Jewish Christians there did (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:13</span>),
and just as Peter did in the house of Cornelius, though he
apologized for the act then (<span class="scripRef">Acts 10:28</span>), and at Jerusalem
when called to account for it (<span class="scripRef">11:1-18</span>). Evidently the question
of social equality was not raised in the Conference at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain came from James,&rdquo; says Paul (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:12</span>). Patrick<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>
admits that they had some connection with James and
may have borne a commission from James, though not to Peter.
It is possible, of course, that rumors of Peter&rsquo;s liberty in
the matter of social intercourse may have reached Jerusalem
(cf. <span class="scripRef">Acts 11:1 ff.</span>), where the pharisaic element in the church
was very sensitive on this point. It is difficult, however, to believe
that James would have felt called upon to send a reprimand
to Peter on the subject, even granting that James opposed
this conduct of Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The Judaizers at Antioch seem to have claimed the sanction
of James and the rest at Jerusalem in their opposition to
Paul and Barnabas (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:1, 24 f.</span>), and it is entirely possible
that on this occasion the visitors from Jerusalem claimed
a connection with James that was not true. Hort<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> thinks it
probable that James merely meant &ldquo;to send cautions to Peter,&rdquo;
with no thought of a rebuke, and that the messengers
proceeded to frighten Peter with threats of a report to
James about his conduct at Antioch.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly true that the horizon of Jerusalem was
not that of Antioch and that Paul would have less sympathy
for what Peter did under fear of consequences at Jerusalem
than for James in Jerusalem, who might not fully comprehend
developments at Antioch. But the Epistle of James and
his speech at the Conference make me slow to believe that he
had gone over to the position of the Judaizers, as Peter did at
Antioch. Paul boldly charged Peter, and even Barnabas, not
with a change of conviction but with hypocrisy (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:13 f.</span>).
Fortunately, it was only a temporary lapse, and both
stepped back to the side of Paul in his championship of a gospel
of equality and freedom for all.</p>
<p>Paul makes no formal charge against James, and under all
the circumstances I prefer to think that James has been misrepresented
at Antioch by the visitors from Jerusalem, who
dared to use his powerful name to whip Peter into line. At
any rate, James, not Peter, seems to be the master spirit at Jerusalem,
as Paul is at Antioch.</p>
<h3>Befriending Paul on His Last Visit</h3>
<p>Paul came to Jerusalem for the last time in the spring
(probably 57 or 58) with a heavy heart. He reveals his apprehensions
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
in <span class="scripRef">Romans 15:31-33</span> and in his address at Miletus
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 20:18-35</span>). He has made a brave fight for liberty in
Christ almost all over the Roman Empire, but the Judaizers
have not ceased their attacks upon him. In particular, during
his long absence from Jerusalem he has been grossly misrepresented
there. He has been frequently warned of trouble if
he came, but he is determined to come in the hope of setting
matters right in Jerusalem and so preventing a schism in
Christianity. He had won at the Conference at Jerusalem
some seven or eight years before.</p>
<p>Hort<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> thinks that Paul entered the city &ldquo;with much precaution
and avoidance of observation&rdquo; under the shelter of
Mnason (<span class="scripRef">Acts 21:16</span>). At any rate, the brethren received him
gladly (<span class="scripRef">21:17</span>), and on the next day Paul made a formal call
on &ldquo;James; and all the elders were present&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">21:18</span>). So here
James is still at the head of the work in Jerusalem as at the
Conference. The apostles were present then as they seem to
be absent now. This is not a conference but merely a friendly
meeting. Paul&rsquo;s rehearsal of his work among the Gentiles
meets with the most cordial expressions of satisfaction
(<span class="scripRef">21:20</span>).</p>
<p>Paul is among his friends, who tell him of a gross misrepresentation
of his position that is current among the Jewish
Christians at Jerusalem to the effect that he teaches that Jewish
Christians must forsake Moses and the customs of the law
(<span class="scripRef">21:21</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> They do not believe it themselves and only wish to
help Paul clear up the matter without interfering at all with
the decision of the Conference about the freedom of the Gentiles
(<span class="scripRef">21:22-25</span>). They suggest that Paul join with four men
in a Nazarite vow, pay the charges for their purification and
for his own, and let all the Jewish Christians see him in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
act of worship and ritual observance of the ceremonial law,
thus proving &ldquo;that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping
the law&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">21:24</span>).</p>
<p>The matter seemed simple enough. Paul had not opposed
the observance of the law on the part of Jewish Christians.
Galatians was written in defense of Gentile liberty. There
was no effort to commit Paul to the necessity of the law for
salvation. As a matter of fact, Paul had kept up his observance
of the Jewish customs save as they affected separation
from the Gentiles. So Paul accepted the advice and made the
offering, &ldquo;purifying himself with them&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">21:26</span>). Apparently
the plan succeeded in setting Paul right with the mass of the
church in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The trouble that led to his arrest arose from the attack of
some Jews (not Christians) from Ephesus, who accused Paul
of defaming the Temple while in the very act of doing worship
in the Temple. We do not know whether the plan of the
elders was the plan of James. Certainly if he had disapproved
he would have spoken out, as the meeting was at his house.
But it was all meant in the utmost kindness to Paul, and it is
not possible to show that it was unwise. The incident shows
the greatest friendliness between Paul and James and the
frankest recognition on Paul&rsquo;s part of the great worth and influence
of James himself. There is no other reference to
James in the New Testament unless it appears in <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 13:7, 17</span>,
&ldquo;them that have the rule over you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Story of His Death</h3>
<p>Clement of Alexandria<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a>
says that James the Just &ldquo;was
thrown from the gable [of the temple], and beaten to death
by a fuller with a club.&rdquo;
Hegesippus<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a>
gives a long and legendary
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
account of the death of James to the effect that the
people of Jerusalem who called James &ldquo;the Just&rdquo; were so enraged
when he bore witness to Jesus as the Son of man that
they flung him down from the gable of the Temple, stoned
him, and a fuller clubbed him. &ldquo;And they buried him on the
spot by the temple, and his monument still remains by the
temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Josephus<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> gives an entirely different and much more
credible narrative of the death of James, placing it about <span class="small">A.D.</span>
62 or 63. He charges the Sadducees through the high priest
Ananus with the death of James and adds: &ldquo;Ananus, therefore,
as being a person of this character, and thinking that he
had a suitable opportunity, through Festus being dead, and
Albinus still on his journey (to Judaea), assembles a Sanhedrin
of judges; and he brought before it the brother of Jesus
who is called Christ (his name was James) and some others,
and delivered them to be stoned, on a charge of being transgressors
of the law.&rdquo; So he won a martyr&rsquo;s crown. He was
called &ldquo;the Just.&rdquo; He had accused the wicked rich of killing
&ldquo;the righteous one&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">James 5:6</span>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c2">II
<br />To the Twelve Tribes Which Are of the Dispersion</h2>
<h3>Simple Address</h3>
<p>The writer is wonderfully simple and direct in his greeting
as compared with Paul in <span class="scripRef">Romans 1:1-7</span>, for instance. There
is no principal verb, and the nominative absolute occurs with
the infinitive, as is so common in the letters found in the papyri.
Originally a word like &ldquo;sends&rdquo; may have been used also.
But this short address is in perfect keeping with the business-like
character of James and the pointed, pungent tone of the
epistle.</p>
<h3>The Readers</h3>
<p>They are evidently not a local church. &ldquo;The twelve tribes
which are of the Dispersion&rdquo; naturally refers to the Jews who
are scattered in the Gentile world outside of Palestine. The
technical term <i>diaspora</i> occurs in only two other places in the
New Testament (<span class="scripRef">John 7:35</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:1</span>). In John the word
has its usual significance. The Jewish leaders scoffed at Jesus
as a failure in Palestine. Perhaps he meant to go and teach
the Jews of the dispersion. The term &ldquo;twelve tribes&rdquo; in James
merely means the Jews as a whole in the dispersion, for the
tribes were not preserved in a distinctive way outside of Palestine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The &ldquo;lost ten tribes&rdquo; evidently had no significance for
James. As a matter of fact, they are no more &ldquo;lost&rdquo; than Judah
and Benjamin. The Jews of Palestine after the destruction of
Jerusalem by the Romans were once more scattered abroad,
as their ancestors had been twice before, to mingle as &ldquo;Jews&rdquo;
in various parts of the world. Doubtless, modern Jews are
simply a blend of all the twelve tribes. At the time when
James wrote, the Jews were very numerous in all the great
commercial centers of the world, such as Alexandria, Antioch,
Babylon, Ephesus, Miletus, Pergamum, Rome, Thessalonica.
But it is more than probable that James has in mind
chiefly the Eastern dispersion in Babylonia and Mesopotamia,
as Peter (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:1</span>) addressed the Western dispersion.</p>
<p>But was James writing to Jews who were not Christians?
Was he making an appeal to the non-Christian Jews of the
dispersion to become Christians? The idea is not without fascination
in itself. Dr. J. H. Moulton<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> contends that this is precisely
what James has done, as is shown by the avoidance of
specific reference to Christ and to the cross so as not to give
offense to the Jews whom he wishes to win. Dr. George Milligan<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>
replies that it is not possible to think of &ldquo;a Christian
teacher of James&rsquo;s position suppressing his distinctive beliefs
under any circumstances whatsoever.&rdquo; But the author does
<i>not</i> conceal his view of Jesus. In the very first verse he speaks
of &ldquo;the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and these words give his human
name Jesus, his title Christ (Messiah), and his lordship
(deity). Besides, in <span class="scripRef">2:1</span> James speaks of Jesus as the object of
faith and so of worship, as Moffatt<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> correctly has it: &ldquo;As you
believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Glory.&rdquo; See also
<span class="scripRef">5:7</span>, &ldquo;until the coming of the Lord&rdquo; (cf. <span class="scripRef">5:8</span>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>There are no doctrinal discussions of the cross and the resurrection,
but all this is distinctly implied. James also announces
himself as a Christian in <span class="scripRef">1:1</span> and could not wish to
conceal the gospel if he meant to win Jews to Christ. Moreover,
he draws a distinction between the Christians (&ldquo;ye&rdquo;)
and their oppressors (&ldquo;they,&rdquo; apparently rich Jews) in <span class="scripRef">2:7</span>:
&ldquo;Do not they blaspheme the honorable name, by which ye
are called?&rdquo; That &ldquo;name&rdquo; is the name of Christ.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> Compare
also <span class="scripRef">2:6</span>: &ldquo;Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag
you before the judgment-seats?&rdquo; Besides, James claims the
readers as believers, &ldquo;my brethren,&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">2:1</span> and <span class="scripRef">5:7 f.</span> There
are, doubtless, passages where James pictures unbelieving
Jews, as in <span class="scripRef">2:6 f.</span> just mentioned and in particular <span class="scripRef">5:1-6</span>, that
vivid apostrophe to the rich Jews of the time.</p>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:1</span> we find the other instance of <i>diaspora</i>, or dispersion.
Here Peter seems to mean by &ldquo;the elect who are sojourners
of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia, and Bithynia&rdquo; not merely Jews or Jewish Christians but
all Christians, whether Jews or Gentiles, in the spiritual dispersion,
&ldquo;sojourners&rdquo; from the true Palestine or promised
land (heaven). Is this the idea of James? Zahn<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> takes this
position and finds that the writer is addressing all Christians
in general, whether those persons would be Jews or Gentiles.</p>
<p>But surely the author has in mind simply Christian Jews
outside of Palestine. The use of the word &ldquo;synagogue&rdquo; as a
place of worship (<span class="scripRef">James 2:2</span>) on a par with &ldquo;church&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">5:14</span>)
argues for this interpretation. He is addressing the Christian
Jews, who now have many problems, and he may have hoped
by means of these believing Jews to reach the wider circle of
unbelieving Jews. He speaks of Abraham as &ldquo;our father&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
(<span class="scripRef">2:21</span>). He assumes that for his readers the Mosaic law is still
binding (<span class="scripRef">2:9-11</span>; <span class="scripRef">4:11</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<h3>The Occasion</h3>
<p>This we do not know. Unlike most of Paul&rsquo;s epistles, there
are no personal details. We are left to conjecture, as in the
case of Jude and 1 John. The picture drawn in the epistle is
that of Jewish Christians of the poorer classes, with a small
number of richer brethren (<span class="scripRef">1:10</span>), struggling for life in the
midst of a social and economic environment that was utterly
unsympathetic, not to say hostile. The process of adjustment
was difficult and perilous. There were perils to the individual
and to the church life, and James shows real mastery of the
situation that confronted the Jewish Christians in the middle
of the first century in the scattered regions where they were
found. He writes to them in a firm tone but with manifest understanding
and sympathy.</p>
<h3>Character of the Epistle</h3>
<p>The book, small as it is, is a little gem in conception and expression.
It reminds one of portions of the book of Proverbs,
some of the Psalms, portions of the Prophets, the Twelve Patriarchs,
the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, the Wisdom
of Solomon, Philo, and the Sermon on the Mount. It is quite
possible that both Paul and Peter had read the Epistle of
James; at least there are several coincidences between them.
At any rate, there seems to be some literary connection between
some of Paul&rsquo;s epistles (Rom., 1 Cor., Gal.), 1 Peter
and Hebrews, and the Epistle of James. Some contend that
the epistle makes use of these New Testament books.
M. Jones<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> thinks that the author had some knowledge of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Stoic philosophers, but this could have come through Hellenistic
Judaism, as for instance the Wisdom of Solomon and
Philo.</p>
<p>The author, as already shown, writes in the smooth and
easy <i>Koine</i> of a gifted and cultivated Jew of Palestine. One
does not have to say with Patrick<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> that James had a wide
knowledge of classical Greek. He may never have read a line
of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; Greek, but he knew well the current Greek of
his day and used it with fine skill. It is not a labored production
and is in no sense artificial. The author is full of the Old
Testament and writes like one of the prophets; yet he has a
firm grip upon the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The book forms a fine link between the Old and New Testaments.
James, the brother of the Lord Jesus, understands
the Old Testament and loves Moses still. He seeks to interpret
Christianity more fully on its ethical and social side to
the Jewish Christians of his time, who are in sad need of help,
beset as they are by Jew and Gentile, and with an imperfect
grasp of the new gospel. They find in this epistle just what
they need to make practice correspond to profession, to
square life with creed. The lesson is still needed today. There
is a peculiar pertinence about the teaching of James that appeals
to modern men who are nothing if not practical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c3">III
<br />Joy in Trial</h2>
<p>Evidently these early Jewish Christians had their share of
trial. Who, alas, does not have his portion? The problem with
us all is to learn how to find the spring of joy in the midst of
sorrow. There are always perplexities and anxieties. The sea
is restless even in its moments of calm beauty.</p>
<h3>Variety in Trials (<span class="scripRef">1:2</span>)</h3>
<p>There is the tone of an elder brother in this epistle, and we
see it at the start when James says &ldquo;my brothers.&rdquo; It is no perfunctory
phrase with him. It is &ldquo;trials,&rdquo; not &ldquo;temptations,&rdquo;
that James here has in mind, though the same word probably
means temptation in <span class="scripRef">1:12</span>. The word in the Greek came to
have either sense, though originally it meant only to try, to
attempt, just as our English word &ldquo;tempt&rdquo; was at first simply
&ldquo;try.&rdquo; But it is a short step from &ldquo;try&rdquo; to &ldquo;make trial of&rdquo; one
when suspicion exists or evil desire arises. Hence all through
the Greek we find the old Greek word used in both senses.
The New Testament usage varies. There are a half dozen
other passages where the word has the idea of trial (<span class="scripRef">Luke 22:28</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Acts 20:19</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 4:14</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:6; 4:12</span>; <span class="scripRef">Rev. 3:10</span>). In
<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:6</span> the identical expression &ldquo;manifold trials&rdquo; appears.
Oesterley<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> wrongly insists that &ldquo;temptation&rdquo; is the meaning
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
in <span class="scripRef">James 1:2</span> on the ground that &ldquo;the writer&rsquo;s Judaism is
stronger than his Christianity,&rdquo; and he then uses it as an argument
against the genuineness of the book.</p>
<p>A soldier (Parry) does have &ldquo;true joy&rdquo; in victory over
temptation, like Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;happy warrior,&rdquo; but that is
beside the mark here. There is no conflict here with the avoidance
of temptation urged by Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:13</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 11:4</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Matt. 26:41</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 22:40</span>). James refers rather to external
trials into which men fall&mdash;trials that are not only unwelcome
but also unsought and unexpected.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> It is almost the
picture of a stumble in the dark when one finds himself surrounded
by hostile forces, just as the poor man fell among
robbers (<span class="scripRef">Luke 10:30</span>).</p>
<p>Besides, one may be surrounded by all sorts of trials at
once and not merely any sort of trial (Moffatt). The word
&ldquo;manifold&rdquo; is really many-colored, variegated, spotted, mottled,
pied, dappled. &ldquo;It never rains but it pours,&rdquo; we say at
such a time. The same word is applied to the sicknesses and
torments of body and mind which Jesus healed (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 4:24</span>).
It is used of the evil desires that lead silly women astray
(<span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 3:6</span>), of the lusts and pleasures which once the Cretans
served (<span class="scripRef">Titus 3:3</span>), of the variety in the manifestation of
God&rsquo;s power in connection with the gospel (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 2:4</span>), of the
many sorts of strange teachings then afloat (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 13:9</span>) of
which we are now beginning to learn something (incipient
Gnosticism and the early stages of Mithraism, for example),
of the many trials which brought sorrow to the Christians
(<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:6</span>), and of the many sides to the grace of God
(<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 4:10</span>). God has grace for every trial whatever its
color, whether black or blue, yellow or green, red or crimson.</p>
<p>The way to face them all is with joy in the heart and a
smile on the face. We are not asked to rush into trials and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
make mock martyrs of ourselves. We are not asked to rejoice
because of the trials, many or few. Much depends on how we
treat the problem of trial, much of which is beyond our control,
like poverty in wisdom (<span class="scripRef">James 1:5</span>) and in substance
(<span class="scripRef">1:9</span>) and like persecution (<span class="scripRef">2:6 f.</span>).</p>
<p>We are not to be blind to facts nor to submit tamely to
what can be cured and should not be endured. James is not a
cynic or a stoic but a victorious Christian who has learned
the lesson that thankful joy is easier and wiser than mere dull
resignation (Plummer, <i>in loco</i>). Each trouble may be met by
a special kind of joy as its antidote. The common idea about
&ldquo;all joy&rdquo; is that James thereby means pure joy, nothing but
joy. &ldquo;Greet it as pure joy&rdquo; (Moffatt). That is possible, though
it may also mean &ldquo;bring to bear all that joy has to offer.&rdquo; It
does not mean (Mayor) that all of joy is contained in this
view. At any rate, it is much to know that joy in suffering is
possible, as many saints can testify who have reached the
pure air of fellowship with Jesus in suffering (cf. <span class="scripRef">Phil. 3:10</span>).
The Brother of James said: &ldquo;Blessed are they that have been
persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and
persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely,
for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your
reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that
were before you&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:10-12</span>).</p>
<p>This is part of the fellowship of Christ and of the saints,
the &ldquo;sunshine band&rdquo; of those who have learned to smile in
the midst of tears, like the sunshine in the rain. Paul was able
to say: &ldquo;But we also rejoice in our tribulations&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 5:3</span>).
This is not the joy of the fanatic or of the fakir or of the rhapsodist.
It is the joy of the soul that is at peace with God in
Christ and has also more than earth and hell can take away,
the peace that passes all understanding. The disciples rejoiced
&ldquo;that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
the Name&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 5:41</span>). Even Marcus Aurelius said: &ldquo;Say not
that that which hath befallen thee is bad fortune, but that to
endure it nobly is good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Product of Trial (<span class="scripRef">1:3</span>)</h3>
<p>The rule of Christian joy thus expounded stands the test of
experience. The word &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; is the one used for experimental
knowledge as opposed to mere intellectual apprehension.
The tense (present participle) expresses continuous acquisition
of fresh knowledge from experience. It is the school
of life where we learn most of what we really know. The position
of James is thus in thorough harmony with psychology.
The command to rejoice in the midst of manifold trials, paradoxical
though it seems, is one that the Jewish Christians
knew to be true from their experience of grace. Johnstone<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a>
has a fine word: &ldquo;Affliction lets down a blazing torch into his
own nature&mdash;and he sees many things which he little expected
to see.&rdquo; One of the marvels of modern science is the
use of electric light by divers at the bottom of the sea to take
pictures of sea life.</p>
<p>It is the biological conception that James has in mind. The
law of life (nature and grace) works through personal experience
and not by mechanical impartation. What do we learn
by experience? &ldquo;That the proving of your faith worketh patience.&rdquo;
Moffatt has it: &ldquo;That the sterling temper of your
faith produces endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notion is plainly that of testing. See the same phrase in
<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:7</span>. Thus James, as Paul, regards faith as &ldquo;the very
foundation of religion&rdquo; (Mayor). The verb from which the
adjective is derived is common enough for testing a yoke of
oxen (<span class="scripRef">Luke 14:19</span>), the spirits (<span class="scripRef">1 John 4:1</span>), work by fire
(<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 3:13</span>), genuineness of love (<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 8:8</span>), all things
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
(<span class="scripRef">1 Thess. 5:21</span>). Peter (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:7</span>) explains the adjective by
the verb (tested by fire). Compare <span class="scripRef">Sirach 2:5</span>: &ldquo;For gold is
tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.&rdquo;
One is reminded of the Sermon on the Mount. &ldquo;Ye shall
know them by their fruits&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 7:16</span>).</p>
<p>Patience is <i>patientia</i> (<i>patior</i>) and is called by Philo the
queen of the virtues. The Jews (Oesterley, <i>in loco</i>) had had
ample need of this virtue in their checkered history. It is just
the opposite of the &ldquo;superman&rdquo; of Nietzsche, the triumph of
might over right, the will to get what one wishes, right or
wrong. There is inevitable conflict between selfish militarism
and Christianity. It is a pity that Christians have left it to socialists
to make the most vigorous protest against war. But
alas, both Christians and socialists are swept under by the
vortex of war <i>nolens volens</i>. And yet by &ldquo;patience&rdquo; James
does not mean inertia or lack of ambition. It is not complacent
self-satisfaction but the triumph of regulated consideration
of the welfare of others, the victory of love over greed,
the joy of doing without that others may be happy, the happiness
of enduring ill for the sake of Jesus.</p>
<p>It is very hard to remain under misfortune (the literal
meaning of the Greek word for patience) when it cannot be
helped. James does not mean that we are not to try to cure
any of the ills of life, not to overcome ignorance, poverty, disease,
crime. There is here no surcease for the war on the evil
conditions of modern life in home or city or state. But many
things cannot be changed. Others will be alleviated by and
by. Meanwhile the Christian can rise to the height of cheerful,
joyful patience. It is the practice of cheerfulness that we
so much need. We do not have to shut our eyes to the facts of
life and of the human reason and deny the existence of sin
and sickness. We can conquer the bitter results of these evils
by the joy in Christ that drives away despair.</p>
<p>This patience is the product of trial. We are not born with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
supply of patience. It is not bestowed in fulness upon us at
the new birth. Like the manna, we need a fresh supply each
morning. But the habit of mind termed patience is gradually
wrought in us by the discipline of experience. Bitterness is a
possible fruit of sorrow and hard experiences. Bitterness is
written all over some sad faces. That terrible calamity can be
missed, will be missed, if one walks in the way of him who
said: &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn
of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find
rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
light&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 11:28 f.</span>). It may not be easy and light at first,
but it becomes so in the presence of Jesus.</p>
<p>Nobly does Wordsworth interpret it for us all:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Who, doomed to go in company with pain,</p>
<p class="t0">And fear and bloodshed, miserable train!</p>
<p class="t0">Turned his necessity to glorious gain;</p>
<p class="t0">In face of these doth exercise a power</p>
<p class="t0">Which is our human nature&rsquo;s highest dower;</p>
<p class="t0">Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves</p>
<p class="t0">Of their bad influence, and their good receives.</p>
</div>
<h3>Perfection by Patience (<span class="scripRef">1:4</span>)</h3>
<p>There is no other way than the slow way of life. The mushroom
springs up in a night and goes as quickly away. The oak
grows a few inches a year and lasts for centuries. The finest
product in God&rsquo;s garden is the soul of man, ripe with the long
years of toil and sorrow. Luther Burbank learned some of the
witchery of nature by watching her ways with plant life. He
showed great patience and has much to show for it. Give patience
a chance to do its work and keep on giving it a fair
show. Ole Bull said that if he missed practicing on his violin
one day, he noticed the difference in his playing. If he missed
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
two days, other musicians noticed it. If he skipped three days,
all the world knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only, let your endurance be a finished product&rdquo; (Moffatt).
It comes to that in all great achievements, for the test is
endurance. The goal is at the end of the race, where Jesus is
the author and finisher of the faith which we possess (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 12:2</span>).
&ldquo;We are become partakers of Christ, if we hold ...
firm unto the end&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 3:14</span>). &ldquo;But he that endureth to
the end, the same shall be saved&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 24:13</span>).</p>
<p>Patience calls for courage; discouragement leads to impatience
and failure. There is need of long-suffering (<span class="scripRef">Col. 1:11</span>),
if we get the &ldquo;finished product.&rdquo; The word for perfect
here occurs also in <span class="scripRef">James 1:17, 25; 3:2</span>. The word, like the
substantive, has a double usage (cf. <i>finis</i> and our <i>end</i>), either
limit or aim. So the perfect man may be regarded in the absolute
sense, the limit, as the perfect Man Christ Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 4:13</span>),
or as on the way to the goal (no longer a child but a
developed man, as in <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 2:6</span>; <span class="scripRef">Phil. 3:15</span>). &ldquo;The perfect&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 13:10</span>) is still to come, but there is &ldquo;perfect love&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">1 John 4:18</span>). We are to aim after the perfection of God himself
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:48</span>). Paul&rsquo;s ambition was to present each one
&ldquo;perfect in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Col. 1:28</span>). Compare also <span class="scripRef">Colossians 4:12</span>.
Here James has his eye on the goal which is at the
end of the long road. He knows full well (<span class="scripRef">3:2</span>) that in many
things we all stumble, but we must persevere. Patience must
do its &ldquo;perfect work,&rdquo; that ye may be &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But James takes a latitudinal look at the work of patience,
not merely the longitudinal view&mdash;the view that ye may be
&ldquo;entire, lacking nothing,&rdquo; &ldquo;complete, with never a defect&rdquo;
(Moffatt). This word for entire (cf. <i>integer</i>) means complete
in all its parts, whole, not unsound anywhere. At the end of
the race we are to be fully developed and sound to the core
in heart and limb. The word is used of stones untouched by a
tool (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 27:6</span>), of a body without blemish. Epictetus (bk.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
III, chap. xxvi, &sect; 25) uses the word of a vessel which one
finds whole, unbroken, and useful. It is used of a complete or
unbroken household. In the papyri Philo uses both words together,
as James does here.</p>
<p>The substantive is used of the &ldquo;perfect soundness&rdquo; of the
man just healed by Peter and John (<span class="scripRef">Acts 3:16</span>). This adjective
occurs with &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Wisd. 15:13</span>) and &ldquo;worship&rdquo;
or &ldquo;religion&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">4 Macc. 17</span>). The adjective is used by
Paul in his prayer for the Thessalonians, &ldquo;preserved entire,
without blame&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Thess. 5:23</span>). This is what Jesus does for
his glorious church, which is to be without &ldquo;spot or wrinkle
or any such thing&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 5:27</span>). Jesus, our High Priest, &ldquo;has
perfected for ever them that are sanctified&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 10:14</span>).
Alas, Isaiah (<span class="scripRef">1:6</span>) found Israel wholly wanting in this soundness.
James&rsquo;s ideal is that we shall fall short in nothing. Our
destiny is to dwell in the family of God and to be like Jesus,
our elder Brother (<span class="scripRef">1 John 3:2</span>). This ultimate divine fulness
is not the self-sufficiency of the stoics.</p>
<h3>Shortage in Wisdom (<span class="scripRef">1:5</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Defective in wisdom,&rdquo; Moffatt puts it. It is the same word
that occurs at the end of <span class="scripRef">verse 4</span>. James is fond of catching up
a preceding word and going on with it, even if, as here, in a
new sense. &ldquo;If any of you lacketh wisdom,&rdquo; James gently
hints. Who is it that does not feel his shortcoming here, at
times with painful intensity?</p>
<p>What does James mean by wisdom? It is more than knowledge.
It is more than mere intelligent apprehension of acquired
knowledge. Tennyson says: &ldquo;Knowledge comes, but
wisdom lingers.&rdquo; James shows familiarity with the Wisdom of
Jesus the Son of Sirach (Ecclus.)<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> and possibly also the so-called
Wisdom of Solomon. Certainly he knows the book of
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Proverbs. But here he does not use wisdom in a philosophical
or mystical sense.</p>
<p>With James wisdom is the right use of one&rsquo;s opportunities
in holy living. It is living like Christ in accord with the will
of God. In <span class="scripRef">3:13-17</span> he gives a formal discussion of the two
sorts of wisdom. Bede suggests that we need wisdom to know
how to look at trial in the true light. Yes, and we need it to
give patience the chance to do its perfect work. Paul uses
wisdom in the special sense of God&rsquo;s wisdom as shown in the
gospel as infinitely superior to the wisdom of the world which
scouted the cross of Christ. &ldquo;We speak wisdom among them
that are perfect&rdquo; (the mature, <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 2:6</span>, AV).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament wisdom is sometimes the intelligence
of God (<span class="scripRef">Prov. 8:22-30</span>). &ldquo;Ten measures of wisdom
came down from heaven, and nine of them fell to the lot of
the Holy Land&rdquo; (<i>Kiddushim</i>, 49<i>b</i>). With James the source of
wisdom is God, not the Jews. So then, when our supply runs
short, ask of God. It is like a bank to which we go to get our
money. God is the banker whose supply of wisdom never
gives out. Unlike other bankers, he asks no security save the
name of Jesus.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> That name gives us full credit at the bank of
heaven.</p>
<p>On that basis God &ldquo;gives to all men without question or reproach&rdquo;
(Moffatt). We have it expressed as &ldquo;liberally&rdquo; in the
standard versions. It is a rather difficult word to translate
into English. It means simple, singlefold, sincere. Compare
the &ldquo;single&rdquo; eye in <span class="scripRef">Matthew 6:22</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 11:34</span>. In <span class="scripRef">Romans 12:8</span>
it is not clear whether singleness or liberality is the idea,
but &ldquo;liberality&rdquo; is obviously correct in <span class="scripRef">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>, &ldquo;the
riches of their liberality.&rdquo; So it is in <span class="scripRef">9:11, 13</span>, but &ldquo;singleness
of heart&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">Ephesians 6:5</span> and <span class="scripRef">Colossians 3:22</span>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Oesterley finds the notion of James to be &ldquo;singleness of
aim, the aim being the imparting of benefit without requiring
anything in return.&rdquo; Likewise, Bengel interprets it by <i>simpliciter</i>.
Either idea makes good sense, for surely God gives to us
all with singleness of purpose and also without bargaining on
God&rsquo;s part, for there is no idea of reciprocity. &ldquo;Without question&rdquo;
(Moffatt) suggests an understanding with God, which
is true. It is the normal, natural thing for a child of God to
come to God and ask of him, for he &ldquo;upbraideth not.&rdquo; A fool
upbraids, the Son of Sirach says (<span class="scripRef">Ecclus. 20:15</span>). Instead of
upbraiding us for asking, rather we are made to wonder why
we did not ask sooner.</p>
<p>God does not chide us for our folly but gives us good measure
of wisdom to take its place. This is the literal truth, as
many self-confessed fools of the world are glad to testify.
They have left the folly of a worldly, selfish, sinful life for the
rich joy of the service of God in Christ. The change may
come in a moment, for after all, this new view of life and the
power to live it may be had for the asking. &ldquo;And it shall be
given him.&rdquo; It will be given on request, with no other identification
than the plea of the sinner who comes in the name of
Jesus, the &ldquo;open sesame&rdquo; to the treasures of heaven, himself
the wisdom of God (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 1:30</span>) in whom are all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge hidden (<span class="scripRef">Col. 2:3</span>). God does
ask of us that we use this wisdom for his glory and for the
blessing of other lives, the enrichment of other hearts.</p>
<h3>Doubting Prayer (<span class="scripRef">1:6-8</span>)</h3>
<p>Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 7:7 f.</span>) had urged the disciples to ask, with
the promise that God would answer.</p>
<p>There is a condition attached to the wide-open invitation
in <span class="scripRef">James 1:5</span>. &ldquo;But let him ask in faith,&rdquo; James adds. By faith
James means not a body of doctrine but trust in God, a working
confidence in God that leads one to ask and to expect to
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
receive what he asks. It is certain that God does not answer
some prayers, at least in the way expected. Some requests
ought not to be granted, in fact ought never to be made.
Prayer may be very foolish as well as very wise. God does not
offer to grant every whim of a spoiled and petulant child. But
assuming that one is asking for wisdom, which surely is a
proper prayer for anyone to make, even so he may miss it
because he does not exercise wisdom in the asking. He must
not chill the ardor of his desire by hesitation and doubt. Let
him ask, &ldquo;nothing doubting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To doubt is to have a divided mind that draws him two
ways, like the poor donkey that starved because he could
not choose between the two stacks of hay. Such a man is like
a wave of the sea (&ldquo;Like a cork floating on the wave, now
carried towards the shore, now away from it,&rdquo; Mayor), one of
the most transitory things imaginable, driven by the wind
and tossed into sea foam (whitecaps) as if blown by a fan or
bellows, a veritable &ldquo;brain storm&rdquo; of perplexity and indecision.</p>
<p>God does answer prayer, but not the prayer of a man who
insults the Giver of whom he asks a favor. Timid faith is quite
another thing. That Jesus honored, as in the case of the
father who first said, &ldquo;But if thou canst do any thing&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 9:22</span>).
Jesus rebuked him for his &ldquo;if thou canst.&rdquo; Then the
anxious father cried out: &ldquo;Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many difficulties in the way of trust in God today.
Science has left many minds groping in the dark without
God, feeling after him if haply they may find him, not knowing
that he is nigh to each of us. We do not have an absentee
God. He can and does hear the cry of his children for help. If
SOS can find a response over the wind and the wave to the
call of the sinking ship, surely it is not strange that the Father
of our spirits will hear our call to him. So it will be, &ldquo;if ye
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
have faith and doubt not,&rdquo; almost the very words used by
James.</p>
<p>Jesus had to rebuke his disciples for their lack of faith
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 8:26</span>) when they thought they were perishing from
wind and wave. And Simon Peter doubted after he began to
walk on the water and started at once to sink. &ldquo;O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?&rdquo; says Jesus to Peter (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 14:31</span>).
Peter had a divided mind. &ldquo;Let not that man think
that he shall receive anything of the Lord.&rdquo; He does not expect
anything, and he is not disappointed. What a commentary
is this sentence upon the halfhearted praying, the lack of
interest, the worldly-minded passive worship of many modern
Christians. There is no wrestling with God in prayer for
victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double-minded creature that he is, wavering at every
turn&rdquo; (Moffatt). The double-minded man is like the two-faced
man (Mr. Facing Both Ways). Sirach (<span class="scripRef">2:13</span>) speaks of
the sinner coming to two paths and being unable to choose.
Such a man perishes at the crossroads. Compare <span class="scripRef">James 4:8</span>
for the only other use of the word in the New Testament,
though common enough elsewhere. Such indecision goes into
duplicity, as Jesus shows about the evil eye and the single eye
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:22 f.</span>). It is a miserable life, as anyone knows who
leads a double life. The double heart leads to the double life,
with its pretended double standard of morals. Clement of
Rome says: &ldquo;Wretched are the double-minded, who doubt in
their heart.&rdquo; No wonder he becomes &ldquo;unstable in all his
ways,&rdquo; not able to stand in all his goings. He wobbles and finally
reels like a drunken man. Such inconstancy winds up in
hypocrisy or abandonment to sin.</p>
<h3>The Democracy of Faith (<span class="scripRef">1:9-11</span>)</h3>
<p>James returns to the keynote of &ldquo;all joy&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">v. 2</span>) and uses
the word &ldquo;glory.&rdquo; The positive note of exultation is the mark
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
of the true Christian against the double-minded man. The
pessimist is not a representative of Christianity. The true optimist
is not, however, blind to the facts of life. He can glory
in God in the midst of all sorts of trials and conditions,
whether in high or low estate. His joy is independent of
earthly estate. The &ldquo;cotter&rsquo;s Saturday night&rdquo; may be as happy
as the one in the castle nearby. Class distinctions are no cause
for pride in a spiritual democracy like the church of Jesus
Christ. We need in Christianity no &ldquo;princes of the church&rdquo; in
the Roman Catholic sense. Pride of rank among the twelve
disciples was a source of grief to Jesus. The rich and the poor
are one in Christ Jesus, and all are poor, miserable sinners
saved by grace.</p>
<p>Johnstone<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> calls this section &ldquo;Rich Poor and Poor Rich.&rdquo;
That is true and is the probable interpretation here. The
humble<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> brother may, after all, be the richest man in the
church&mdash;rich in grace, in love, in joy, in peace, in righteousness,
in fellowship. This is &ldquo;his high estate,&rdquo; which rises sheer
above hovel or palace. Thank God that this infinite wealth
of the spirit is still open to the poor all over the world who
find the door of competency closed in their faces. The pious
poor is more than a phrase. It is often literal fact.</p>
<p>The papyri discoveries<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> bear eloquent testimony to the
words of Paul about the membership of the church at Corinth
(<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 1:26-29</span>). The papyri letters and other documents are
chiefly from the middle and lower classes and reflect the actual
life of the very people from whom the gospel made most
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
of its converts (fishermen, carpenters, publicans, tentmakers,
etc.). There were already some wealthy members of the early
churches, men like Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, Barnabas
of Cyprus. There were &ldquo;not many mighty,&rdquo; but there
were some. There soon came to be large numbers of slaves in
the churches when the gospel spread among the Gentiles. But
already social problems of an acute nature were on hand
when James wrote. In fact, we see such problems in the early
chapters of Acts, when Ananias and Sapphira wished to get
credit for a generosity that they were not willing to show and
when high feeling arose in the distribution of the funds for
the Aramean (Palestinian) and Hellenistic widows among
the Jewish Christians. At no point are people more sensitive
than about money.</p>
<p>So the rich brother is to be reminded of his humiliation,
&ldquo;in that he is made low,&rdquo; placed on a level with the &ldquo;lowly
brother.&rdquo; They meet on the level in Christ. Each is as high
and as low as the other&mdash;no more, no less. The rich man is
not to glory over the poor man, nor is the poor brother to
cringe in the presence of the rich brother. This is the democracy
of faith, the universality of Christ.</p>
<p>The rich brother is in constant peril of pride of possession,
and so James reminds him of the fate of the beautiful flower
of the grass which springs up quickly and withers before the
burning heat and falls off. It is a striking adaptation of the
language of Isaiah (<span class="scripRef">40:6-8</span>), using the imagery for another
purpose. <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:24</span> says: &ldquo;All flesh is as grass, and all the
glory thereof as the flower of grass.&rdquo; Christ brings all men to
their true level, the common humanity in us all, the sonship
in him that makes us heirs of heaven. Moffatt changes &ldquo;his
high estate&rdquo; to &ldquo;when he is raised,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in that he is made
low&rdquo; to &ldquo;in being lowered.&rdquo; He seems to understand that
James refers to the possible ups and downs of life. It will be
easy for the lowly brother in that case to rejoice when he becomes
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
rich; but how about the rich brother when he becomes
poor?</p>
<p>Plummer (<i>in loco</i>) refuses to see a &ldquo;brother&rdquo; at all in the
rich man, but only one of the rich Jews who oppressed the
early Christians, as in <span class="scripRef">James 5:1-6</span>. But that gives an Ebionitic
tone to the epistle. James does indulge in irony, but he
is apparently sincere in his picture here. The rich brother
will fade away in his goings, as if James has in mind a salesman
whose business dries up like a flower. Riches truly have
wings and fly away. They are sweet like the rose but soon
vanish from us forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV
<br />The Way of Temptation</h2>
<p>James powerfully sketches the natural history of temptation
if yielded to and the glory of victory if overcome. The
other sense (temptation) of the word used for trial in <span class="scripRef">1:2</span> occurs
here. Moffatt indeed takes trial as the idea in <span class="scripRef">1:12</span> also
(so does Hort <i>in loco</i>), but certainly in <span class="scripRef">verse 13</span> we have to
say &ldquo;temptation.&rdquo; It is most likely that the idea of temptation
is present in <span class="scripRef">1:12</span>. Here James returns to the discussion of the
other side of the blessing of trials, namely, the blessing of
temptation endured. As a matter of fact, he has not really digressed
from the subject. He merely discusses one aspect.</p>
<h3>Standing the Test (<span class="scripRef">1:12</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.&rdquo; We must
never forget that Jesus warned us against rushing into temptation,
not merely in the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:13</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 11:4</span>)
but also in the agony of Gethsemane, when Satan had
come upon him with renewed energy in spite of repeated defeats
by Jesus since the wilderness temptations (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 26:41</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Luke 22:40</span>). Jesus urged the disciples to pray to be spared
temptation. No one knew so well as he the power of the evil
one. He had wrestled with him to the end and had conquered
where others failed. Temptation is not to be courted,
not even for the sake of the experience and the possible victory.
Too many go down in the struggle for any to rush into it
lightly. &ldquo;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>But if temptation is thrust upon one, then he must fight
and win as Jesus did. There is always a way of escape (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 10:13</span>).
We must find the way out. Compare <span class="scripRef">Job 5:17</span>: &ldquo;Behold,
happy is the man whom the Lord correcteth.&rdquo; He only
is happy (the same word used in the Beatitudes in <span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:3-11</span>)
who endures. That is true patience. It is only &ldquo;when he
hath been approved&rdquo; after standing the test that &ldquo;he shall receive
the crown of life,&rdquo; the victor&rsquo;s crown. The word for approved
suggests the furnace that removes the dross and
leaves the pure metal. The refiner of silver watches, we are
told, till he sees his own image in the metal. Then it is pure.
The metal is tested and approved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crown of life&rdquo; (cf. <span class="scripRef">Rev. 2:10</span>) is probably the wreath
of victory in the games (cf. <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 9:25</span>; <span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 2:5</span>), for
Greek games were common in Palestine in the days of Herod
the Great and were practiced even in Jerusalem itself (Josephus,
<i>Ant.</i> 15, 8, 1 f.). It is a crown of kingly glory, but it is
bestowed as reward of merit to those who love the Lord Jesus.
We may have a reference to a Logion of Jesus not preserved
in which he makes this promise: &ldquo;Blessed is he who hath his
raiment white, for he it is who receiveth the crown of joy
upon his head.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a> In <span class="scripRef">Proverbs 1:9</span> we read that the instruction
of father and mother &ldquo;shall be a chaplet of grace unto
thy head.&rdquo; In <span class="scripRef">Sirach 15:6</span> we read of &ldquo;a crown of gladness,&rdquo;
and in the <i>Testimony of the Twelve Patriarchs</i> (<span class="scripRef">Levi iv. 1</span>)
we find &ldquo;crowns of glory.&rdquo; Love is the way to win this crown&mdash;love
and the proof of it in enduring temptation and leading
&ldquo;the white life.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Blaming God (<span class="scripRef">1:13</span>)</h3>
<p>Whatever doubt exists in <span class="scripRef">verse 12</span> about trial or temptation
vanishes in <span class="scripRef">verse 13</span>. Here it is clearly temptation to evil. Hort
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
(<i>in loco</i>) suggests &ldquo;tempted by trial,&rdquo; and Moffatt puts it
&ldquo;tried by temptation.&rdquo; Certainly trial becomes a temptation
to some men who use it as the excuse for doing wrong.
&ldquo;Though trial in itself is ordered by God for our good, yet the
inner solicitation to evil which is aroused by the outer trial is
from ourselves&rdquo; (Mayor). Any trial wrongly used may become
a temptation, whereas it was meant for our development
and perfection. Temptation is merely one aspect of trial
and not a necessary one. But the word is used of the great
tempter (<span class="scripRef">1 Thess. 3:5</span>). So Jesus was tempted by Satan in the
wilderness (<span class="scripRef">Mark 1:13</span>). Satan desired to sift the apostles as
wheat, to ruin them if possible (<span class="scripRef">Luke 22:31</span>). The Pharisees
and the Sadducees sought to tempt Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 15:1</span>). It is
the devil&rsquo;s business to seek to lure another into wrong.</p>
<p>When a man is tempted and yields to the temptation, he is
eager to blame someone else for his sin. If he cannot do otherwise,
he will blame God for having made him as he is, with
evil possibilities. In particular is this true of sexual sin, which
Oesterley (<i>in loco</i>) thinks James has specifically in mind
here. Compare <span class="scripRef">Matthew 5:28</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:11</span>. Adam blamed
Eve, and Eve the serpent. And even Adam blamed God, for
he said: &ldquo;The woman whom thou gavest to be with me&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Gen. 3:12</span>).</p>
<p>Some dare to say in so many words: &ldquo;I am tempted of
God.&rdquo; They hold God responsible for their appetites and passions
and seek to quiet the conscience thus while they give
way to sin. Others hide behind heredity, environment, or
evil companions. Even Agamemnon excused himself for his
wrong to Achilles by holding Zeus and fate responsible. Sirach
(<span class="scripRef">15:11 f.</span>) says: &ldquo;Say not thou, It is through the Lord
that I fell away.&rdquo; The origin of sin is a dark problem, but it is
a lazy philosophy or a blind one that shirks human responsibility,
or tries to do it. It matters not whether sin is the remnant
of the beast in us (surely some men act at times like the
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
tiger) or the response to evil environment or both, we are
merely cowardly when we blame God for our own wrongdoing.</p>
<p>There is no response to evil in God. He is not &ldquo;man&rsquo;s giant
shadow skyward thrown.&rdquo; The absolute holiness and ethical
purity of God should at least protect him from the charge of
leading us into sin. The worst of men, in their darkest moments
of loneliness, sometimes come face to face with God.
Then they do not flippantly blame God but confess their sins
with broken heart. Two things are true about evil and God.
One is that God himself tempts no man to sin. He does send
trial but not temptation. We may not understand all the ways
of God&rsquo;s providence, but we may rest secure in this: The
devil does tempt us. That is his business. And yet James does
not refer to Satan by name here, for after all, we ourselves are
responsible, as he proceeds to show. It does not help matters
with us any more than it did with Eve to lay our sin upon the
devil. The other thing that is true is that God cannot be
tempted with evil. He cannot be tempted to do evil himself
or be led to tempt others with evil. The phrase does not occur
elsewhere in the New Testament or in the Septuagint, but it
is a paraphrase of a common proverb in the early Christian
writings.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> God does chastise us (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 12:4 f.</span>), but he does
not tempt us.</p>
<p>All this is in strong contrast to the Greek and Roman notions
of duty, for the heathen gods were credited with all human
and even inhuman vices. The gods upon Olympus revel
in lust and cruelty, jealousy and hate. They furnish fit ideals
for the philosophy of Nietzsche but do not accord with the
God of the New Testament, the God of consolation and of
peace, of purity and love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h3>Snared by One&rsquo;s Own Bait (<span class="scripRef">1:14</span>)</h3>
<p>The man himself is responsible for his sin, and he need not
seek to place the blame elsewhere. The temptation is not a
temptation to him if he refuses to listen to the siren&rsquo;s voice.
The man is not responsible for the efforts of others to allure
him to sin but only in case he listens and yields. Then he is
really tempted &ldquo;when he is drawn away by his own lust, and
enticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure is very bold and impressive. The word for
&ldquo;drawn away&rdquo; is used in Oppian for drawing the fish out
from its original retreat, beguiling it from under the rock.
Then the fish is ready to be snared by the bait. The fish bites
at the bait and is caught on the hook. So with a man. He is
drawn out by his own lust for the sin placed before him. In
the case of sexual sin the impulse is not in itself sinful any
more than the fish&rsquo;s hunger for food. The sexual nature is
from God and is meant only for blessing for high and holy
ends. But the misuse of this impulse is very easy and very
dreadful in its results. Satan sets many kinds of bait for unwary
boys and girls, men and women, who at first are taken
off their guard and then are drawn away by desire stirred
within them toward evil. The evil suggestion is entertained,
and sin is the outcome.</p>
<p>This very word &ldquo;entice&rdquo; is used of hunting (trapping with
bait), and then it is used of the harlot who entices to sin. &ldquo;My
son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Prov. 1:10</span>).
Philo speaks of our being &ldquo;driven by passion or enticed by
pleasure.&rdquo; The pitfalls are many in modern life&mdash;in the country,
in the village, and in the city. The modern demons of
drink, drug, and the brothel are busy in finding victims. But
the point made by James is that the one who yields does so
because of the sin within his own heart.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s own evil desire plays the part of temptress
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
(Plummer), and he is drawn away by it and enticed. &ldquo;If
thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 4:7</span>)
like a panther ready to spring upon the intended victim
caught for the moment off guard. One is reminded afresh
of the opening chapters of Proverbs, which cannot be excelled
by any of the modern books on sex instruction, some
of which stimulate more immorality than they prevent. Wise
warning is needed and plain talk is demanded, but not
pruriency any more than prudery. Alas, that the paw of the
modern Moloch draws into the fire so many thousands of
young men and women from the homes of our land. The
best capital of America is the children, and we lose too
much of it in the worst of gambles&mdash;the traffic in souls.</p>
<h3>The Abortion (<span class="scripRef">1:15</span>)</h3>
<p>The natural history of sin as the result of temptation to
which one yields is given with scientific accuracy and
graphic power: &ldquo;Then the lust, when it hath conceived,
beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth
forth death.&rdquo; Moffatt renders it thus: &ldquo;Then Desire conceives
and breeds Sin, while Sin matures and gives birth to
Death.&rdquo; It is a gruesome picture surely. But who can say
that it is overdrawn?</p>
<p>The positivist tries to shut God out of the world and so to
banish human responsibility; but alas, he cannot banish
human woe and anguish of heart. The agnostic flings up
his hands in despair and says he does not know and has
nothing to say in the presence of nature, &ldquo;red in tooth and
claw.&rdquo; The brutal militarist adopts the rule of physical might
wrongly claimed by Nietzsche to be the mark of the superman.
Spiritual and moral prowess should dominate brute
force in man, else he becomes only a brute himself. He drops
back to the law of the jungle and rejects the law of love in
the kingdom of heaven. The Christian Scientist blandly
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
shuts his eyes to such errors of mortal mind as sin and sickness
and sorrow and, ostrich-like, cheerfully denies their
reality and seeks to blow them away with a puff. But sin is
not to be brushed aside in this way.</p>
<p>The words of this verse call for particular remark. &ldquo;Then&rdquo;
is here the historical order following the temptation to which
one yields. His lust drew him forth to the temptation. He
yields, and the result is the conception; the embryo develops
into sin. This is the first birth, and sin is the child of
desire. Desire is not in itself sinful, but it easily falls into sin.
Thus in a true sense desire makes sin where there was no
sin and so gives birth to sin. But this is not all. Sin in its turn
matures and gives birth to death.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> This second child is like a
child born dead.</p>
<p>When sin is born, death is involved like an embryonic
parasite that feeds on sin. Desire, sin, death form the biological
line of pedigree. The line is short, for &ldquo;the wages of
sin is death,&rdquo; as Paul puts it (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 6:23</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> The picture in
James is that of an abnormal birth like a misshapen animal.
I have seen a five-legged cow, the fifth leg on the top of
the back standing up straight. When sin is born, death begins
(conception) and grows in fascinating power till a
new birth comes; and lo, this child is death itself. &ldquo;The birth
of death follows of necessity when once sin is fully formed,
for sin from its first beginnings carried death within&rdquo; (Hort,
<i>in loco</i>).</p>
<p>The law of death in sin applies to other sins besides the so-called
sexual sins which write their history so plainly in the
body and the mind and bring a heritage of woe through all
the family history. There is here no sowing of wild oats to
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
raise a crop of wheat. The fearful fidelity of modern scientific
knowledge throws a lurid light on this passage in James.
The sinner makes his bed and lies down in it and drags down
with him the helpless ones who are thrown in his care.</p>
<p>As I am writing I receive a copy of <i>Light</i>, a magazine
published by the World&rsquo;s Purity Federation. The issue for
November, 1914, contains an article by a woman who has
lived &ldquo;twenty-five years in the underworld.&rdquo; Her story reads
like a commentary on the words of James. She claims to have
had the best of that sordid life, but she concludes: &ldquo;No matter
what humiliation a girl has to endure, it is better to endure
it than to get into this life. There is nothing in it for any
of them. The very best of us get it hard before we die. And,
at the best, it is Hell.&rdquo; The issue of death is seen not merely
in the diseases of the body but &ldquo;also in the deterioration of
mind and character which accompanies every kind of sin&rdquo;
(Mayor, <i>in loco</i>). Death and hell then claim their own.</p>
<h3>God, the Source of Good (<span class="scripRef">1:16 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>The contrast is sharp. &ldquo;Be not deceived&rdquo;; do not wander so
in your minds as to think that temptation and sin and death
come from God. He is not the source of evil. Rabbi Chaninah
says: &ldquo;No evil thing cometh down from above.&rdquo; Note Jesus
in <span class="scripRef">John 8:23</span> on &ldquo;above&rdquo; and &ldquo;below.&rdquo; James is tenderly affectionate
in his appeal on this point&mdash;&ldquo;my beloved brethren.&rdquo;
On the contrary, only good comes from God. God is
good, and he alone is absolutely good (<span class="scripRef">Mark 10:18</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> In the
Greek the next sentence runs like a hexameter line if one
short syllable is considered long by stress of the meter.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> We
need not tarry over a fanciful straining after poetical lines in
prose. Oesterley agrees with Ewald in seeing here a quotation
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
from a Hellenistic poem. It is far more likely just accidental
rhythm common enough in good prose. The scholars
differ also as to how to translate the sentence. Moffatt has it:
&ldquo;All we are given is good, and all our endowments are faultless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Father of lights&rdquo; sets God over against the worship
of the sun so common among the ancients. Plato (Repub. vi.
505 ff.) compares the sun to the idea of the good. Modern
science powerfully illustrates this comparison of James in
bringing out what we owe to the sun in the way of light,
heat, and life itself. Philo calls God &ldquo;the Father of the all,&rdquo;
the lights (the moon and the stars) and all else in the universe.
&ldquo;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of
man, that thou visitest him?&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 8:3 f.</span>). Compare <span class="scripRef">Philippians 2:15</span>.
God is not only light (<span class="scripRef">1 John 1:5</span>), but all
true light comes from him&mdash;all the light that lights every man
coming into the world (<span class="scripRef">John 1:9</span>).</p>
<p>But the sun appears to move rapidly. Watch the sun drop
like a ball of fire at sunset and thus cast a deepening shadow
over the earth. The sundial is one of the oldest ways to mark
&ldquo;the shadow that is cast by turning.&rdquo; Mayor quotes Plutarch
(Percl. 7) for the use of this figure for shadows cast on the
dial. James is here, of course, using popular language, as we
still do when we say that the sun rises and sets. But with our
Father of lights there is &ldquo;no change of rising and setting&rdquo;
(Moffatt). He &ldquo;casts no shadow on the earth.&rdquo; Even the
polestar, we now know, whirls on in space, carrying the
worlds along with it. But our God is not changeable or
whimsical. He does not send now good, now ill. He knows
how to give good gifts to those that ask him, yea, the best of
all gifts, the Holy Spirit (<span class="scripRef">Luke 11:13</span>). What seems ill is
really good if it comes from God. If one takes his stand by
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
God&rsquo;s side and looks at his life, he sees God&rsquo;s plan as a whole
for his own life and for God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<h3>The New Birth (<span class="scripRef">1:18</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;So far from God tempting us to evil, his will is the cause
of our regeneration&rdquo; (Mayor). He is our Father in a double
sense. We owe our original birth to God, in whose image we
are made (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 2:7</span>). We owe our spiritual birth likewise to
God, who begat us again to a living hope (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:3</span>). The
Mishnah (<i>Surenh.</i>, iv. 116) says: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s father only
brought him forth into this world: his teacher, who taught
him wisdom, brings him into the life of the world to come.&rdquo;
Happy is the father who leads his child also to Christ. But
while the word of truth is the instrument used in the instruction
(a pointed lesson for parents, teachers, preachers), the
actual work of regeneration is due to God as Father, yes, and
as Mother also, for the word &ldquo;brought forth&rdquo; is the one used
of the mother (see by contrast <span class="scripRef">v. 15</span>).</p>
<p>The doctrine of grace here set forth is of a piece with that
in Paul&rsquo;s writings (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 12:2</span>; <span class="scripRef">Eph. 1:5</span>), those of Peter
(<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:3</span>), and of John (<span class="scripRef">1:13</span>). Indeed, Jesus himself is
quoted as saying: &ldquo;Ye did not choose me, but I chose you&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">John 15:16</span>). As the seed of sin produces death, so the seed
of God produces life (<span class="scripRef">1 John 3:9</span>). It is interesting to note
this piece of fundamental theology in so practical a writer as
James, who lays special emphasis on works as proof of life.
But James has no such idea as some careless and shallow
theologians who think that a man can galvanize himself
into spiritual life by imitative ethics. The man must be born
again, as Jesus said so impressively to Nicodemus (<span class="scripRef">John 3:3</span>).
The miracle of birth must precede growth and development.</p>
<p>We are not to puzzle ourselves too much over the mysteries
of spiritual biology. We know that the impulse and
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
purpose<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> come from God (<span class="scripRef">John 1:13</span>). What we do know
is that God honors and uses the word of truth, both spoken
and written. If this is true, what a responsibility belongs to
us for diligence and urgency in the use of the word of
truth.</p>
<p>By the truth we are set free from sin and error (<span class="scripRef">John 8:31 f.</span>).
The word of truth is the gospel of salvation (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 1:13</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Col. 1:5</span>), the word of life (<span class="scripRef">1 John 1:1</span>). God&rsquo;s word is
truth (<span class="scripRef">John 17:17</span>), and the words of Jesus are spirit and life
(<span class="scripRef">John 6:63</span>). The word of truth, when combined with the
power of God (<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 6:7</span>), quickens into life. So James
emphasizes the importance of the human element in the new
birth, while rightly making God supreme in the act of regeneration.
We must reach men with the word of God. We
must pass it on to the thirsty, the hungry, the dying. Every
church is, or ought to be, a lifesaving station, a rescue mission,
a teaching center, a powerhouse, a lighthouse radiating
knowledge of God in Christ.</p>
<p>The purpose of God in renewing us by the word of truth
is that we in turn should win others. We are not an end in
ourselves, though God does save us. He saves us that we may
serve. We are to be a sort of first fruits,<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> not the full harvest.
There are fields upon fields beyond us ready for the reaper.
We are just a beginning, just a foretaste. We whet the appetite
for larger, richer blessings. &ldquo;The trees that are a fortnight
to the fore are the talk and delight of the town.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> One
spring my baby boy noticed a tree without leaves when all
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
the rest were in leaf. &ldquo;What is the matter with this tree?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Christ has introduced a new order into the world. He himself
is the real first fruits (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 15:20</span>). But there are others
through all the ages&mdash;those that ripen first and fast, show
the way, give promise of the future. So Epaenetus was a
first fruits of Asia for Christ (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 16:5</span>); the household of
Stephanas was in Corinth (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 16:15</span>). Blessings rest on
the first fruits for salvation in any church, any town, any
family. They are the chosen of God, like the 144,000 in the
book of Revelation (<span class="scripRef">14:3</span>), the church of the firstborn (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 12:23</span>).
The Jews consecrated their first fruits to God as his
in a special sense. All Christians are meant to be first fruits,
the promise and earnest of better work (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 8:23</span>). God
has in store great things for his people. The least that we can
do is to bring our first and our best, our all, and lay it at the
feet of Jesus. The new heaven and the new earth may not
come while we live on earth, but we may help heaven to
come upon earth by living the life of God.</p>

<h2 id="c5">V
<br />The Practice of the Word of God</h2>
<p>Nowhere is James richer than in this wonderful paragraph
in <span class="scripRef">verses 19-27</span> of the first chapter. He has in mind &ldquo;the
word of truth&rdquo; of <span class="scripRef">verse 18</span> and follows that idea with pungent
and powerful words that remind one of the Sermon on the
Mount. It is not clear whether the first part of <span class="scripRef">verse 19</span> belongs
in idea to what goes before or what follows. &ldquo;Ye know
this, my beloved brethren.&rdquo; It makes perfectly good sense
either way. It is also uncertain whether we have a statement
or a command, for the form may be either indicative or imperative.
If you know it, act on your knowledge. Let us
listen to what the Word has to say, since we are renewed by
the use of it, and be less captious in our criticism of its teachings
(Mayor). Moffatt puts it, &ldquo;Be sure of that, my beloved
brothers,&rdquo; and connects it with <span class="scripRef">verse 18</span>.</p>
<h3>Brilliant Listening (<span class="scripRef">1:19a</span>)</h3>
<p>By &ldquo;swift to hear&rdquo; James brings a vivid picture before us.
Moffatt has it &ldquo;quick to listen.&rdquo; Sirach (<span class="scripRef">5:11</span>) has a like command:
&ldquo;Be swift in thy listening.&rdquo; One thinks of fleet of foot,
yes, and of ear. The Vulgate has <i>velox</i> here. The wild animals
(and the Indians) of necessity have keen ears and can hear
the slightest rustle of a leaf or crackling of a twig. The rabbit,
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
so often hunted by man and dog, pricks up his ears at the
sound of a pin dropping. The use of the telephone and radio
have given added importance to the value of the ear. The
ancients relied very much on the ear, for the reader of books
had a wide-awake audience who depended on the ear rather
than the eye for information.</p>
<p>The mechanism of listening is very wonderful, the contact
between brain and brain through the sound waves of speech
and the reception of the spoken words by the ear. Jesus often
said: &ldquo;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo; The ear with
many was, and is, the sole avenue of acquiring knowledge.
It is no disparagement of books to say that the art of conversation
is one of the greatest refinements. But the very essence
of a good conversationalist is that he be also a good
listener; else he is a consummate bore. Sydney Smith said of
Macaulay that his occasional flashes of silence made his conversation
delightful. In <i>Qoheleth Rabba</i> we read: &ldquo;Speech
for a shekel, silence for two, it is like a precious stone.&rdquo;
Broadus had a great lecture on &ldquo;The Art of Listening.&rdquo; It is
a really rare art and one of the most useful.</p>
<p>Poor listening will make poor preaching of a really good
sermon. Good listening will come near to making a good
sermon out of a poor one. The writer of Hebrews complains
that his readers have become dull of hearing. The word
&ldquo;dull&rdquo; means no push. They had no push in their ears, no
energy in listening, were already half asleep. In particular
do we need to listen when God speaks to us in his Word of
truth, to have &ldquo;a quick and attentive ear to catch what God
has spoken&rdquo; (Hort). Inattention is irritating and may be
deadly. Sirach says: &ldquo;The mind of a sagacious person will
meditate on a proverb; and an attentive ear is the desire of a
wise man&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">3:29</span>). God is constantly speaking to those
with ears to hear. It is good for the young to learn the habit
of attention, a help in meeting temptation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h3>Eloquent Silence (<span class="scripRef">1:19b</span>)</h3>
<p>Another life rule of James (Windisch) is &ldquo;slow to speak.&rdquo;
One must not forget Homer&rsquo;s &ldquo;winged words,&rdquo; for words can
be laden with messages of joy and life and peace and love.
Eloquence has its place, real eloquence of the soul&mdash;words
on fire that blaze and burn, words that thrill and electrify,
words that make life and death noble and high, words like
those of Jesus that are spirit and life (<span class="scripRef">John 6:63</span>). But when
all is said, there is something deeper than mere speech,
higher than just words, nobler than talk. If speech is silvern,
silence is often golden.</p>
<p>Sorrow may be too unutterable for words. Joy may pass
beyond all speech. The proverb also has it that &ldquo;many a man
has had to repent of speaking, but never one of holding his
peace,&rdquo; unless silence is guilty or cowardly. But it is easy to
be voluble with the tongue and slack in life. Sirach says: &ldquo;Be
not violent with thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss.&rdquo;
Volubility is certainly not a sign of power. The silent
man, like Moses, is more likely to be a man of power and
performance. The parrot and the owl form good examples
of the weakness of chatter and the wisdom of silence. Zeno
calls attention to the obvious fact that we have two ears and
one mouth and should therefore listen twice as much as we
talk.</p>
<p>James does not, of course, mean that men should be slow
and dull talkers after they begin to talk. He means slow to
talk, not slow in talking. Often the least interesting men
are the very ones who talk most frequently and at the greatest
length. We are to think twice before we speak. Sometimes,
if we do that, we shall not speak at all. At any rate, we shall
be more likely to have sense in our speech. We shall speak
to more purpose if we speak after silence and out of the reflection
from silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>McLaren has a good phrase, &ldquo;Spread out our souls to the
truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rdquo; Mary &ldquo;kept all
these sayings, pondering them in her heart&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 2:19</span>).
She could only listen to God. The Quakers have some ground
for their plea for meditation in the Christian life. Introspection
can, of course, be overdone, but the present age is not
given to reflection and contemplation. Practical mysticism is
the best type of Christianity. Indeed, Christianity without
mysticism is empty and formal.</p>
<p>It is quite possible (Johnstone) that the free conversational
style employed in the early Christian meetings was
taken advantage of by contentious persons, with the result
of serious wranglings, as in the church at Corinth (cf. <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 14</span>).
&ldquo;In the multitude of words there wanteth not
transgression; but he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Prov. 10:19</span>). Such violent talkers break up the spiritual
life of a church. The less they know, the more they talk. They
have positive opinions on every subject of politics or religion.
They know how their neighbors should act in the smallest
details and criticize everybody and everything. They are
happiest when all is agog with talk of some sort; and the
more gossipy it is, the better they like it. &ldquo;They cannot think,
and it is a relief to them to hear their own voices&rdquo; (Dale).
Epictetus (Ench. xxxiii, &sect;5) has the same idea as James:
&ldquo;Let there be silence for the most part or let that which is
necessary be said in few words.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Dull Anger (<span class="scripRef">1:19c f.</span>)</h3>
<p>The third life rule of James is &ldquo;slow to wrath.&rdquo; There is a
clear connection between speech and anger. Anger inflames
one to hasty and unguarded talk. In turn, the words act as
fuel to the flames. The talk inflames the anger, and the anger
inflames the talk. The more one talks, the angrier he becomes&mdash;like
a spitfire. If one stops talking, his anger will cool
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
down for lack of fuel. Men who are dull enough in listening,
who will sleep through any sermon, are quick to resent
a personal reflection or an imagined wrong. Often one&rsquo;s manhood
is gauged by his quickness to avenge a personal affront,
with murder as the outcome. This is a fine place to be
dull, when one is tempted to be angry.</p>
<p>Anger is sometimes justifiable, even necessary. There is
such a thing as righteous indignation against wrong. Jesus
&ldquo;looked round about on them with anger&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 3:5</span>), but it
was compassionate anger. It is possible to be angry and sin
not (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 4:26</span>), but we must not let the sun go down upon
our wrath. Unlike God, we do not know all the circumstances
in the case. Getting mad is not promoting the kingdom
of God. &ldquo;The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness
of God.&rdquo; (Compare <span class="scripRef">Matthew 5:21 f.</span>) The euphemistic
phrase of James is emphatic by its very mildness. Man&rsquo;s
wrath is set over against God&rsquo;s righteousness. The growth of
religion and of civilization is marked by the self-restraint of
the individual and of the state. Vengeance is a boomerang
in most instances. The taking of vengeance into one&rsquo;s own
hands brings down the house on one&rsquo;s head. Not only is
unhappiness brought to others; immeasurable harm is done
in one&rsquo;s own life.</p>
<p>At any rate, it pays every man and every nation to be slow
to anger.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Boys, flying kites, haul in their white-winged birds;</p>
<p class="t0">You can&rsquo;t do that way, when you&rsquo;re flying words.</p>
<p class="t0">Thoughts, unexpressed, may sometimes fall back dead,</p>
<p class="t0">But God himself can&rsquo;t kill them once they&rsquo;re said.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes unpalatable truth has to be spoken, hard words
have to be said. &ldquo;Am I become your enemy by telling you
the truth?&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 4:16</span>). But the preacher needs to temper
rebuke with love and anguish of soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h3>The Rooted Word (<span class="scripRef">1:21</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The implanted word&rdquo; is probably a mistranslation. The
common idea of the word is &ldquo;inborn&rdquo; or &ldquo;innate&rdquo; (cf.
<span class="scripRef">Wisd. 12:10</span>, &ldquo;their wickedness is inborn&rdquo;). The word is occasionally
used for second nature or secondary ingrowth
(Hort). The word is sown, not grafted, and so &ldquo;rooted&rdquo;
seems to be the meaning here (Mayor). See also <span class="scripRef">Romans 6:5</span>,
&ldquo;united with him in the likeness of his death.&rdquo; The figure
is that of the seed sown in the heart and taking root and
growing there. So Jesus spoke of the man who had no root in
himself (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 13:21</span>).</p>
<p>Receive the rooted word; but before doing so, one must
cleanse the heart like a garden of all noxious weeds. The
imagery is doubtless a mixed metaphor, but never mind that,
for the thought is clear. The &ldquo;putting away&rdquo; suggests the
laying aside of a garment, as in <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 12:1</span> one strips for
the race. In <span class="scripRef">Ephesians 4:21</span> Paul contrasts putting off the
old man with putting on the new (cf. also <span class="scripRef">Col. 3:8 ff.</span>). Mayor
notes the comparison between dress and character in the
wedding garment (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 22:11</span>), the white robe of purity
(<span class="scripRef">Rev. 3:4, 18</span>). In <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:1</span> we have language similar to
that of James, &ldquo;putting away therefore all wickedness.&rdquo; But
probably James means to carry the figure of the garden all
through the verse, as Moffatt has it: &ldquo;So clear away all the
foul rank growth,&rdquo; the weeds of &ldquo;filthiness&rdquo; and &ldquo;overflowing
of wickedness.&rdquo; The &ldquo;filthiness&rdquo; may mean impurity.
Compare Paul&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;corrupt speech,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;rotten
speech&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">Ephesians 4:29</span>. But in <span class="scripRef">Revelation 22:11</span>, &ldquo;And
he that is filthy let him be made filthy still,&rdquo; the notion is
more general.</p>
<p>Another noxious weed that must be gotten out of the way
is &ldquo;wickedness,&rdquo; which here may have the narrower sense of
malice. &ldquo;What was called holy anger was nothing better
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
than spite&rdquo; (Hort). It is even suggested that the &ldquo;overflowing&rdquo;
is a sort of overgrowth or excrescence (Hort), but with
no idea of admitting that a small amount of wickedness or
malice is not evil. The precise figure is an ebullition or effervescence
of malice. Surely one too often sees this picture
in actual life. Malice bubbles up and runs over into word
and deed. &ldquo;The evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth
forth that which is evil&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 6:45</span>). He speaks out of the
abundance of his heart. Surely evil runs riot unless it is
checked and taken out, root and branch. Per contra one loves
to think of the abundance of grace (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 5:17, 21</span>) and the
abundance of joy (<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 8:2</span>).</p>
<p>When once the weeds are out of the way, &ldquo;make a soil of
modesty for the Word which roots itself inwardly&rdquo; (Moffatt).
Surely the repentant sinner can only &ldquo;receive with
meekness.&rdquo; Hort notes that the temper full of harshness and
pride destroys the faculty of perceiving the voice of God.
Jesus urged men to come to school to him, because he is
meek and lowly in heart (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 11:29</span>). Meekness is not a
virtue that ranks high with all men. Many of the ancients
counted it a vice, as Nietzsche has taught in our generation.
But the spirit of Nietzsche&rsquo;s superman is not the spirit of
Jesus or of the true gentleman. There can be no true culture
without gentleness and the grace of meekness.</p>
<p>If the seed of the Word gets root and is allowed to grow
(compare the wayside, stony-ground, thorny-ground hearers
in Christ&rsquo;s parable in <span class="scripRef">Matt. 13</span>), the tree of life will flourish
in the garden of the soul. This word is &ldquo;able to save your
souls.&rdquo; It brings a present salvation here and now (<span class="scripRef">John 5:34</span>),
a new life of purity. It helps in the progressive salvation
of the whole man in his battle with sin and growth in
grace (<span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 3:15</span>). It leads to final salvation in heaven
with Christ in God (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:9</span>). The gospel is the power of
God unto salvation (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 1:16</span>); the very power of God
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
pulses in it. See <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 4:12 f.</span> for a wonderful picture of
the vital force of the Word of God, quick and powerful, all
electric with the energy of the Spirit of God. Men may scoff
at and scout the message of God, but it saves men&rsquo;s souls.
What else does that?</p>
<h3>Hearers Only (<span class="scripRef">1:22-24</span>)</h3>
<p>James keeps the balance well. He has shown the wisdom
of good listening. Now he proves the futility of mere listening
with no effort to put into practice what one hears. There is
life in the Word of God if it is lived. It is quick with life-giving
energy for those who put it to the test of life. One
may hear and not heed. The Greek used the same word for
both ideas. One is reminded of the parable of the sower
again, for only one of the four classes of hearers brought
forth fruit. That is the test. &ldquo;By their fruits ye shall know
them.&rdquo; The reception of the Word will only bring final salvation
in case the fruit is borne.</p>
<p>James knew only too well the empty ceremonialism of the
Jews who said and did not. Jesus (see <span class="scripRef">Matt. 23</span>) arraigned
the hypocrisy of the Pharisees in the most scathing denunciation
of all time. &ldquo;But be ye doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deluding your own selves.&rdquo; Show yourselves
&ldquo;word-doers&rdquo; (Hort). By &ldquo;word&rdquo; it is not clear whether is
meant the Torah (Oesterley) or any word of authority
(Hort), or the rooted word just mentioned (Plummer).
The latter is most likely, though the partial personification
of &ldquo;word&rdquo; here reminds one of the opening verses of the
Fourth Gospel and of Philo and the Targums.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;hearers only&rdquo; did nothing else but listen. They were
true &ldquo;sermon tasters&rdquo; who fed upon the ministry of the Word
or the written word, only to fatten into sloth and spiritual
inertia. They got the hookworm disease in religion and belonged
to the shirkers, not the workers. Rabbi Chananiah
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
used to say: &ldquo;Whosesoever works are in excess of his wisdom,
his wisdom stands; and whosesoever wisdom is in excess of
his works, his wisdom stands not.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> The rabbis said there
were two crowns, one for doing and one for hearing, based
on <span class="scripRef">Exodus 24:7</span>: &ldquo;we will do, and we will be obedient&rdquo;
(&ldquo;hear&rdquo;). The word for hearers appears nowhere else in
the New Testament and was used for attendants at the
lectures of philosophers and other public speakers rather
than learners or disciples. One thinks of the public reading
of the Word in the synagogues. But even so, &ldquo;Act on the
Word,&rdquo; Moffatt has it. Else it is like pouring water into a
sieve. It is in one ear and out of the other.</p>
<p>Some people have a sort of religious dissipation in attending
revival services and imagine that they have accomplished
a great deal if they simply go. People easily acquire
itching ears that love to be tickled with some sensation. The
word takes no root in the hearts of such men. They run from
church to church to get a new word, a sort of soda-water
habit. They deceive themselves but nobody else. These spiritual
&ldquo;gadabouts&rdquo; are shallow and skim the surface only. They
make a sort of motion picture but accomplish nothing substantial
in their own lives or in the work of the kingdom.
They are guilty of a logical fallacy and are the victims of
their own delusions (cf. <span class="scripRef">Col. 2:4</span>). One has thus a case of
autointoxication. He has inoculated himself with the virus
of his own error.</p>
<p>And now James draws a wonderfully vivid picture of the
idle hearers, the hangers-on in revival meetings, like the
scum that comes first to the surface, lighthearted, impulsive,
nonchalant, without depth of purpose or seriousness in life.
Such a frivolous listener glances at his face in a mirror, taking
note to see that he looks natural and proper. A quick look
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
suffices for that, for &ldquo;his natural face,&rdquo; the face of his birth,
the only one that he has. If nothing is awry about his appearance
reflected in the mirror, he is satisfied (or dissatisfied)
with the momentary glance. The mirror was probably
of metal, and the word is often used by the poets (Mayor).
Here the mirror is the Word of God (spoken or written) by
which one takes a look at himself, and the quick and superficial
view brings satisfaction or a passing pang. See <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>
for the use of &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; for the imperfect knowledge
of Christ through reflection in the Word of God and in
life contrasted with the blessed reality when face to face
with him (Mayor). But here in James the man tarries by the
mirror for a moment and soon moves off.</p>
<p>All that he saw in the Word of God is now out of sight
and out of mind, like the wayside hearers in Christ&rsquo;s parable.
If it was a sermon that he heard, the impulses for good
quickly die away. He is back at his business, at his club, or in
his home. He straightway forgets what he was like, what
sort of man he was in the mirror. In particular, any unpleasant
features are forgotten. The momentary trembling
of the conscience no longer bothers him. Alas, how easily the
burning heat of the day withers the tender shoots in the stony
ground; the weeds and thorns choke to death the pious aspirations
of the better hours.</p>
<h3>Real Students of the Word (<span class="scripRef">1:25</span>)</h3>
<p>The image of the mirror is carried on into the picture of
the doer of the word, the &ldquo;doer that worketh,&rdquo; a doer of
work, &ldquo;an active agent&rdquo; (Moffatt). The phrase is tautological
but very emphatic. He is not only a doer of word but a
doer of deeds. He has put the word into practice and has
brought practical results. He has transmuted word into
deed. This is what counts, the practice of the Word of God,
not mere glancing at the mirror nor chatter about what one
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
saw or picked up, not a hearer of forgetfulness. It is astonishing
what poor memories men have for what God says. The
<i>Doctrine of Addai</i> gives as an uncanonical saying of Jesus:
&ldquo;That which we preach before the people by word we should
practise by deed in the sight of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sincere listener pauses long enough to become interested
in the real meaning of the Word of God, which is now
law to him, for he wishes to obey this Word of the Master.
These listeners are the joy of the preacher&rsquo;s heart, those who
turn to the Scriptures, like the Bereans, to see if these things
are so (<span class="scripRef">Acts 17:11</span>). The word in James suggests curiosity
and eagerness, as in <span class="scripRef">Sirach 14:23</span>, of the one who looks
through the door of wisdom, and in <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:12</span>, the desire
of the angels to peer into the problems of the mission of
Christ to earth. The law of God is attractive and perfect to
the doer of work, as the psalmist has it: &ldquo;The law of the Lord
is perfect&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 19:7</span>). But it is not a law of compulsion
but of freedom. One is free to accept or to reject it. Certainly
James does not have the view of the Judaizers, who
made the law a yoke of bondage even for Gentiles, but
rather that of Paul, who accented the freedom in Christ (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 5:1</span>).
Jesus held out freedom as the great blessing of truth
(<span class="scripRef">John 8:32</span>)&mdash;freedom to exercise one&rsquo;s highest functions
and faculties held in bondage by sin and mere legalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the chief emphasis in this verse lies in the word
&ldquo;continueth.&rdquo; The man remains by the side of the roll of the
law spread out before him and unrolls page after page with
the keenest interest and zest until he rightly grasps the
meaning of God. Thus he puts the Word into practice. He
has it stamped on his mind and heart. He is a Christian
pragmatist. He, like Brother Lawrence, practices the presence
of God. He translates the word of truth into his own
life and becomes a living epistle. This is the Bible that the
twentieth century loves to read. The man who does this is
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
&ldquo;happy in his doing,&rdquo; &ldquo;blessed in his activity&rdquo; (Moffatt).
He is happy in the doing, even if it falls far short of the ideal
in the word of truth. He has tried, and he will keep on trying.
He can sing the song of the shirt, the song of the plow, the
song of the desk.</p>
<h3>Complacent Religiosity (<span class="scripRef">1:26</span>)</h3>
<p>Mere listening may be idle. Mere work may be perfunctory.
One may be a worker only as well as a hearer only.
The hearer only deceives himself by an error of reason
(<span class="scripRef">1:22</span>). The worker only deceives his own heart by an error
of conduct. He leads himself astray, out of the path, by the
delusion that religion consists in the performance of religious
duties, not in the attitude toward God in the heart or the
ethical conduct. Paul uses the term for Pharisaism (<span class="scripRef">Acts 26:5</span>)
and in <span class="scripRef">Colossians 2:18</span> for the worship of the angels. It
is the external aspect of public worship. Originally it had
the meaning of reverence for the gods (Hort), but it soon
came to be used for the ceremonial rites of worship. In <span class="scripRef">4 Maccabees 5:6</span>
the word is used for the refusal of the Jews
to eat pork.</p>
<p>In a word, it is applied to one who does faithfully the
religious chores. The Pharisees form a striking illustration
of this emphasis on the ceremonial side of public worship.
The regular attendance at the hours of prayer, faithful
observance of the rules of ritual purification, payment of the
tithes&mdash;these things constituted worship. Finally, these
<i>alone</i> constituted worship. Religion came to consist in the
ceremony alone, the letter and not the spirit, the hull and
not the kernel.</p>
<p>Most of the things done were good enough. It is good to
have the outside of the cup clean but not so important as the
inside or as clean water in the cup. Jesus exposed this failing
of the Pharisees with great incisiveness and power. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
easy to mistake form for reality. So men have come to count
their beads as prayer, to pray with prayer wheels. A person
may attend church regularly, contribute liberally, come to
prayer meeting, have family prayers, be a member of the
church, and yet not be religious. He may have religiosity
and not religion. One may mistake performance of religious
functions for the possession of the spirit of religion. In
the very act of working out the religious impulse men often
fall into traps. So here the man considers that he is a religious
man. He is content with his religious status, and yet he
does not control his tongue. &ldquo;He bridleth not his tongue&rdquo;;
this is the earliest known use of this striking figure, though
Aristophanes speaks of an unbridled mouth.</p>
<p>The tongue is regarded as an unruly horse that needs bit
and bridle held fast by the master to control it. The tongue
is allowed to say whatever a spiteful heart prompts. The
bitterest words are not felt to be inconsistent with personal
piety. Such a man considers himself a pillar of the church in
spite of his loose tongue and loose living. He performs religious
duties on Sunday and is a shyster on Monday. He
deceives himself, but no one else is deceived. Such a man&rsquo;s
religious service is empty of any value with God or man. It
is vain and hollow mockery. His own complacency makes
the matter worse. He is a stumbling block to those who judge
religion by him, for he has divorced religion from life.</p>
<h3>Unspotted from the World (<span class="scripRef">1:27</span>)</h3>
<p>James does not give a definition of religion in this verse
but an illustration of the right sort of religious exercise in
contrast with the futile religiosity already noted. The absence
of the article shows that he does not mean an inclusive
description. &ldquo;A religious exercise pure and undefiled&rdquo; is
here given quite the opposite meaning of the professional
performances of the pharisaic pietists. There is pure religion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
and the counterfeit is a tribute to it. This religion is free
from pollution. There is in it no alloy of selfishness nor other
sin. Moffatt renders it &ldquo;unsoiled,&rdquo; but it may have the notion
of genuine metal.</p>
<p>This standard of purity and piety seems impossible, but
God knows how to estimate the relation between listening
and doing, between doing and loving, between loving and
purity of life. The life must pass muster with God. At first
sight one is perhaps depressed by the reflection that God&rsquo;s
standard of piety is so much higher than ours. What some
men consider holy worship is to God hollow mockery. But
then God is our Father. He planted the word of truth in our
hearts. He has watched it grow. He knows the limitations of
environment in which the tree of life has grown.</p>
<p>James gives two very practical tests of genuine religion.
One is mercy toward the suffering. The widow and the orphan
appeal to the hardest hearts. And yet men have been
known to spend thousands of dollars upon palaces of worship
while the poor perished in the alley behind the church.
The social side of practical religion is receiving more attention
these days than it once did. The very hospitals and
asylums are an expression of that love for our common
humanity taught by Jesus. James has no sympathy with that
cold orthodoxy that is satisfied with singing psalms to
Jehovah while the widow and the orphan suffer, with no
help from the blind worshipers nearby.</p>
<p>Christianity is inward and spiritual, not mere perfunctory
ritual. But it is not mere mystical brooding or abstract contemplation.
The cry of the child and the cry of the mother for
the child were heard by Jesus. Today the children cry aloud
in our streets and in our factories for school and play, for
love and sympathy, for better homes and better food, for
care of the body and of the soul. Jesus still loves the children.
Christ discovered the child. The modern world at last has
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
begun to find out the child that Jesus has placed in the midst
of us. There are many other forms of social service which
the true Christian may find right by his door. The neighbor
in need may even lie at his gate.</p>
<p>The other test of pure religion offered by James is more
distinctly personal and more difficult, though the first test
is met none too well. It is &ldquo;to keep oneself unspotted from
the world.&rdquo; Moffatt has it &ldquo;from the stain of the world.&rdquo; It is
a high calling surely if one is to walk in a world like this free
from the stain of sin, with no spot upon garments, body, or
soul. The Lamb of God was offered as a sacrifice without
spot. Christ will present his church at last without spot.
James had just spoken of the use of the tongue. That also
can leave a spot or stain (cf. <span class="scripRef">3:6</span>).</p>
<p>There is much dirt of all kinds about us. The germs of sin
infest and infect us all. And yet it is not hopeless to make a
fight for purity in life. We do not give up the battle for
cleanliness of body, for healthfulness of body, for victory
over the germs of disease about us and in us. It is worthwhile
to lead the clean, white life of purity. One has his
reward in his own life&mdash;in fresh power, in new joy, in richer
fruitage. He has his reward also in the inspiration given to
others, who are cheered to strive likewise against sin, to fight
for personal and social purity, for better homes and better
cities, for a better world in which to serve God, for a bit of
heaven here on earth, for the reign of God in human hearts,
for likeness to Jesus the Son of God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI
<br />Class Prejudice</h2>
<p>In the second chapter James recurs to the discussion of
the democracy of faith found in <span class="scripRef">1:9-11</span>. In fact, it had
never been very far in the background. The use of &ldquo;my brethren&rdquo;
is eminently appropriate here, since he is urging the
readers to brotherly kindness (Mayor).</p>
<h3>Face Value in Religion (<span class="scripRef">2:1</span>)</h3>
<p>This is a very hard verse to translate at once, for we must
decide three disputed questions. One is whether the verb
is imperative or interrogative. It is taken as imperative in
most versions, and so most interpreters hold, but Hort urges
that it is a tame conception compared with the indignant
query expecting the answer no. There is force in this point,
as thus James would be expressing vehement surprise that
such partiality could exist among the Jewish Christians.
Still, the prohibition against such partiality makes good
sense.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that &ldquo;the faith of our Lord Jesus
Christ&rdquo; should be rendered &ldquo;faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
It is objective, not subjective, genitive. For a similar use of
the objective genitive with faith one may note <span class="scripRef">Mark 11:22</span>
and <span class="scripRef">Acts 3:16</span>. It is not the faith of Jesus that is under discussion
but the faith of the readers in Jesus Christ our Lord.
This interpretation commits James to the worship of Jesus
as Lord and Messiah, but that is surely what would be expected
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
in one who claimed to be a &ldquo;servant of God and of
the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1:1</span>). It is true that the standpoint
of James is nearer to that of the Old Testament than is true
of Peter, John, and Paul, but after the great Pentecost there
seems to be no wavering on the great fundamentals of
Christianity, though there is rich development and enlargement.</p>
<p>The essence of the Christology of James is precisely that of
Paul, though James does not amplify his implications as Paul
does. James, though very Jewish in background, is thoroughly
Christian. The heart of Christianity, the worship of
Jesus as Lord and Saviour, is here, though chronologically
the Epistle of James precedes the teaching of Paul and John
in their writings. It is like the child and the man (Plummer),
not a retrograde movement. It is the outlook of Jerusalem,
not that of Antioch. What James is discussing is not the personal
religion of Jesus but the reader&rsquo;s faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>The third disputed point in the verse is the word &ldquo;glory.&rdquo;
The English versions generally insert the words &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;
and make it &ldquo;the Lord of glory,&rdquo; but Bengel makes &ldquo;the
glory&rdquo; <i>ipse Christus</i>. In this he is followed by Mayor, Hort,
and Oesterley; and it is almost certainly true that by &ldquo;glory&rdquo;
James has in mind the Shekinah. In the Septuagint for <span class="scripRef">Leviticus 26:11</span>
the word for Shekinah is just that used in <span class="scripRef">Revelation 21:3</span>:
&ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men.&rdquo;
In <span class="scripRef">John 1:14</span> we read: &ldquo;And the Word became flesh, and
dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the
only begotten from the Father).&rdquo; Add to this <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 1:3</span>,
&ldquo;who, being the effulgence of his glory,&rdquo; and the case seems
made out. In <i>Pirke Aboth</i> iii. 3 we note: &ldquo;Two that sit together
and are occupied in words of Thorah have the Shekinah
among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus claimed, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered in
my name, there am I in the midst of them&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 18:20</span>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
Jesus is thus not only the Way, the Truth, the Life, and the
Resurrection but also the Glory. James may have in mind the
resurrection glory of Jesus as he appeared to him. In <span class="scripRef">Luke 2:32</span>
Simeon says: &ldquo;The glory of thy people Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all this is by way of emphasis for the main point. One
who has faith in such a Lord as Jesus should not be guilty of
&ldquo;acts of partiality&rdquo; (Hort). The meaning of the phrase is
clear, though the origin is obscure.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> The Greek use of the
word for mask is illustrated by the word for hypocrite. In
<span class="scripRef">Leviticus 19:15</span> we see the full force of the idiom: &ldquo;Thou
shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person
of the mighty.&rdquo; See <span class="scripRef">Acts 10:34</span>, where Peter learns that God
is no respecter of persons.</p>
<p>God does not accept the outside appearance for the inner
reality&mdash;nor should we. God is the God of reality. (Compare
<span class="scripRef">Heb. 4:12 f.</span>) A just judge must not be influenced by the bias
of personal preference, prejudice, rank, power, money
(Mayor). He must decide the case on its merits. There is no
room for class prejudice or for the caste system in Christianity,
as there is none in the heart of God. Christianity is
democratic to the core, that is, real Christianity. Organized
Christianity has sometimes been the very thing that James
here condemns. Even in the single church little rifts and
cliques easily develop.</p>
<h3>Partiality in Church (<span class="scripRef">2:2-4</span>)</h3>
<p>Already the Jewish Christians were in peril from this evil.
It is, in particular, a sin of ushers who show respect of persons
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
in seating strangers. But pastors are in constant danger of
the same sin in general church relations. The word here for
synagogue may mean place of worship or the assembly itself,
as in <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 10:25</span>, &ldquo;the assembling of yourselves together.&rdquo;
The word for church does not occur in the apostolic
period (Hort) for place of meeting, but synagogue was
already in common use in both senses. But it is not necessary
to suppose that James has in mind simply a Jewish synagogue,
though it is quite possible that the Jewish Christians
still attended worship and heard Moses read in the synagogue
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:21</span>), as Christians belonged to the synagogue
of the Libertines (<span class="scripRef">Acts 6:9</span>) and the early Christians
worshiped still in the Temple.</p>
<p>The use of &ldquo;your&rdquo; seems to mean that it is at least a Christian
gathering that James refers to, whether meeting in the
Jewish synagogue or elsewhere. &ldquo;The growth of the Gentile
element in the church excited the active hostility of the Jews
against the whole body of Christians, as it troubled the Jewish
converts themselves&rdquo; (Westcott on Hebrews, p. xxxviii).
Finally the Christians had to set up for themselves, as in Corinth
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 18:7</span>) and in Ephesus (<span class="scripRef">Acts 19:8 f.</span>). We do not
know the precise stage reached by the Jewish Christians
here. James may mean some particular instance of trouble in
the dispersion that came to his notice, or he may have in
mind any Christian gathering in the dispersion. The Gentiles
often attended the worship of the Jews in the synagogues
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 13:16, 43</span>). The use of &ldquo;synagogue&rdquo; for Christian worship
occurs rarely, as in Hermas, <span class="scripRef"><i>Mand.</i> xi. 9.</span> The time came
when synagogue was used only for Jews or heretics. Epiphanius
(<i>Haer.</i> xxx. 18) says that the Ebionites call their
meeting &ldquo;synagogue,&rdquo; not &ldquo;church.&rdquo; One may note also John&rsquo;s
use of the term &ldquo;synagogue of Satan&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rev. 2:9; 3:9</span>).</p>
<p>The picture of the two strangers at church is drawn with
bold lines and in few words by James; yet it is remarkably
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
clear and picturesque. The man with a gold ring probably
makes a display of his ring. If he preached, he would make
most of his gestures with that hand. The word occurs nowhere
else in the New Testament. Mayor quotes Epictetus
(<i>Diss.</i> 1. 22) as speaking of an &ldquo;old man with gold fingers.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;fine clothing&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;brilliant clothing,&rdquo; &ldquo;new
glossy clothes&rdquo; (Hort), &ldquo;the fine white garment worn by
wealthy Jews&rdquo; (Oesterley), like that in which Herod Antipas
clad Jesus when he sent him back to Pilate. One can easily
see the distinguished-looking stranger as he steps in at the
same time as &ldquo;a poor man in vile clothing,&rdquo; &ldquo;in dirty clothes&rdquo;
(Moffatt), &ldquo;old shabby clothes&rdquo; (Hort). See <span class="scripRef">Revelation 22:11</span>
for the same adjective for &ldquo;filthy.&rdquo; In <span class="scripRef">James 1:21</span> we had
&ldquo;filthiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have no means of knowing whether these two men who
suddenly enter church are Christians or simply Jews. Both
seem to be strangers. The courtesies extended are based
purely on the appearance of these two as to dress, not on
race or ecclesiastical standing.</p>
<p>The poor man may be one reduced to beggary&mdash;a tramp
or hobo. He may be a poor working man. He stands in
marked contrast with the rich man, as in <span class="scripRef">1:9-11</span>. Probably
the poor man had on the best clothes that he had. Should a
man like that come to our churches? Would he be welcome
in our pews? To be sure, cases occur when a bath would
help matters and when plain, but clean, clothes could be
provided by Christian people so as to make attendance at
church free from embarrassment. But there are people, especially
children, who stay away from both Sunday school
and church because they do not possess decent clothes in
which to come. They fear the critical eyes and comments of
the people at church.</p>
<p>It is easy to say that people should rise above such unfavorable
circumstances and come on to church to worship
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
God, who reads the heart and does not judge men by their
clothes. Yes, but a man may conclude that he can worship
God just as acceptably and more comfortably in some other
church where the usher does not seem so ashamed of his
coming or embarrassed by his presence that, in spite of
plenty of empty pews in the grand temple of worship, he
finds a back seat for him under the gallery or in the gallery on
a footstool (literally, &ldquo;under my footstool,&rdquo; probably &ldquo;on the
floor by my footstool&rdquo;), in a corner, or a place to stand
against the wall. Meanwhile, the poor man has seen the attentions
paid the man in fine clothes; he is ushered to a good
seat with the air of a prince.</p>
<p>The soul of the poor man is all the more embittered, since
he came perhaps in a sort of desperation from the hardness
of the world outside, a world that has economic and social
laws that make the battle a difficult one. And now in the
temple of God the worshipers of Jesus show the same pride of
wealth and station as at a social function. The preacher
talks of forgiveness of sins and the comfort of the Holy
Spirit; but he and the ushers keep a sharp eye upon the man
who wears the fine clothes, pompous and self-conscious as
that man probably feels. The soul of the poor man is made
more bitter still as he leaves the church of the rich and the
proud to see if he can find God at home or the devil in the
saloon or other den of iniquity.</p>
<p>One pity of it all is that so many churches have fine,
empty, cushioned seats, while the strangers who could fill
them are not sought for or not properly welcomed if they
come. It is a pathetic picture that James here gives us&mdash;that
of the stranger at the door of the church. Most strangers
pass the door of the church by with indifference or disgust.
The church must win the strangers outside unless it is to
degenerate into a social club of a few select families. A
church that only holds its own will soon lose that standing.
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
The task of the church is to win the world to Christ. And
then when the poor of earth enter, it is worse than folly to
push them to one side and out of doors, back into the street.</p>
<p>This touch of life is one of many modern notes in the
Epistle of James. The embarrassment of the usher in the
presence of two such incongruous strangers at once is probably
due to the fact that he knows full well the atmosphere
or tone of the church. It is aristocratic or select; evangelical
and orthodox, not evangelistic or missionary; a haven of rest
for the stately pious, not a rescue station for the lost. The officers
of the church thus make distinctions between the attendants
at church and sort out the congregation according
to worldly standards. They are &ldquo;judges of evil thoughts&rdquo; and
act with partiality in bestowing courtesies on strangers in the
house of God. All this is in such marked contrast to the spirit
and conduct of Jesus that one can hardly credit his eyes
when he sees it happen in church. It is increasingly difficult
to get the poor to come to some of the churches. The churches
themselves may sometimes become suspicious that the very
poor come to church to receive financial help. So the breach
widens.</p>
<h3>Prejudice Against the Poor (<span class="scripRef">2:5-7</span>)</h3>
<p>James now has fewer maxims and a more argumentative
style, like that of Paul. He makes a passionate appeal for attention:
&ldquo;Hearken, my beloved brethren.&rdquo; He writes as an
impassioned speaker speaks (cf. <span class="scripRef">1:16; 4:13</span>). God&rsquo;s choice of
the people of Israel seems to be in the background (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 14:1 f.</span>).
The Jews had come in many cases to look on earthly
prosperity as a mark of divine favor and poverty as a sign of
God&rsquo;s disfavor (cf. <span class="scripRef">Psalm 73</span>).</p>
<p>The Pharisees were lovers of money (<span class="scripRef">Luke 16:14</span>). But the
troubles of the Jews, in spite of many wealthy Pharisees and
Sadducees, had led many of them to see a blessing in poverty.
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
See Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Gad. vii. 6: &ldquo;For
the poor man, if, free from envy, he pleaseth the Lord in all
things, is blessed beyond all men.&rdquo; Oesterley (<i>in loco</i>) quotes
<i>Chag.</i> 9<i>b</i> as saying that poverty is the quality that above all
befits Israel as the Chosen People. Epictetus (bk. IV, chap.
i, 43) says: &ldquo;Another (thinks the cause of his evils to be) that
he is poor.&rdquo; Epictetus (Stob. 10) says further: &ldquo;Riches are
not among the things that are good.&rdquo; <span class="scripRef">Luke 6:20</span> has: &ldquo;Blessed
are ye poor,&rdquo; where <span class="scripRef">Matthew 5:3</span> has &ldquo;poor in spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is certain that the gospel made a powerful appeal to the
poorer classes of society among Jews and Gentiles. Jesus
claimed it as part of his messianic mission &ldquo;to preach good
tidings to the poor&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 4:18</span>), as Isaiah (<span class="scripRef">60:1 f.</span>) had
foretold. He asked the messengers of John the Baptist to take
back to Macherus the news that &ldquo;the poor have the good
tidings preached to them&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 7:22</span>) as one proof of his
messiahship. Paul enlarges on the choice (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 1:27 f.</span>) by
God of the foolish, the weak, the despised classes to add to
his own glory. The early churches were gathered largely
from the proletariat. Slaves and masters, rich and poor, mingled
together in fellowship and brotherly love.</p>
<p>The papyri discoveries have shown us the world of Jesus
and of Paul &ldquo;in the workaday clothes of their calling.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a>
Deissmann adds: &ldquo;We should be sorry indeed not to have
been told that Jesus came from an artisan&rsquo;s home in country
surroundings.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a> The fact that Jesus was a carpenter, a workingman
in the modern sense of that term, should enlist the
sympathy and the interest of all workingmen. They should
heed the call of the Carpenter.</p>
<p>Here James boldly champions the cause of the poor as
against certain rich Jews, probably not members of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
church, who have oppressed the Christians and dragged
them before courts of justice. With their own hand these rich
Jews had dragged Christians before tribunals. Rich Sadducees
had done this with Peter and John (<span class="scripRef">Acts 4:1</span>). As one
of these potentates, yea, as a tyrant, Paul had once dragged
men and women before the Sanhedrin (<span class="scripRef">Acts 8:3; 22:4</span>). He
had even tried to make them blaspheme (<span class="scripRef">Acts 26:11</span>). It
was not necessary to have special laws against the Christians.
As objects of dislike it was easy enough, as Paul
found out, to hale them into court. Paul came to know only
too well how the tables could be turned on him when he became
a Christian. He had to take his own medicine (<span class="scripRef">Acts 13:50; 16:19</span>).
Jesus indeed had foretold that just this fate
would befall his disciples before the courts of Jews and
Gentiles (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 10:17 f.</span>; <span class="scripRef">John 16:2</span>).</p>
<p>The anger of these rich Jews against Jesus and Christians
leads them actually to blaspheme the name of Christ. The
Sadducees will not even call the name of Jesus when they
discuss the case of Peter and John. They refer with contempt
to &ldquo;this name&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 4:17</span>), though in the threat
they have to name Jesus (<span class="scripRef">v. 18</span>). The disciples rejoiced &ldquo;that
they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 5:41</span>). So &ldquo;the honorable name,&rdquo; &ldquo;the beautiful name,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the noble Name&rdquo; (Moffatt) came to be the shibboleth of
the believers in Jesus. His name was to be &ldquo;the name which
is above every name&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Phil. 2:9 f.</span>). It was already the only
name with power to save (<span class="scripRef">Acts 4:12</span>), as Peter boldly informed
the Sanhedrin. That was the meaning of the name
Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 1:21</span>).</p>
<p>Here one sees afresh the Christology of James. The honorable
name is the name of Jesus, with a possible reference
to the use of it in the baptismal formula&mdash;&ldquo;by which ye are
called,&rdquo; &ldquo;which is called upon you.&rdquo; At any rate, they bear
the name of Christian, given probably as a reproach (<span class="scripRef">Acts 11:26; 26:28</span>;
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 4:14, 16</span>). This name is now their badge
of honor and glory. When called upon to say, &ldquo;Anathema be
Jesus,&rdquo; they reply, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 12:3</span>). Certainly
the early Jewish Christians had everything to make them
fear the powerful rich who had frowned upon Jesus and
his cause.</p>
<p>And yet James dares to say to the Jewish Christians: &ldquo;But
ye have dishonored the poor man,&rdquo; &ldquo;now you insult the poor&rdquo;
(Moffatt). They had done it out of cringing fear of the rich
Jews with all their power, or out of anxiety to please the rich
so as to win them with fawning flattery. We are not to think
that all the Jewish Christians had shown such narrowness or
such cowardice, but some instances had come to the notice
of James. Per contra note the case of Ananias and Sapphira,
who wished to gain credit for great liberality to the poor by
the use of part of the wealth, keeping back half though pretending
to give all. All the early Christians were not poor. The
cases of Barnabas, Joseph of Arimathea, and Lazarus and
his sisters Martha and Mary occur to one at once. Jesus did
not denounce rich men per se, though he did point out with
great power the peril of wealth.</p>
<p>James is not to be understood as denouncing the rich in a
wholesale fashion. Consecration is what sanctifies riches&mdash;the
use of money for the glory of God and the blessing of
mankind. A man is not a child of the devil just because he is
rich or poor. God deals with men in the raw manhood. &ldquo;A
man&rsquo;s a man for a&rsquo; that.&rdquo; The distinction between the upper
and the lower classes is partly fictitious and is not a stable
condition. The slums are a dreadful fact and a disgrace to
modern civilization. People should have decent homes, good
food, fresh air, and clean clothes. Extreme poverty is a peril
to a man&rsquo;s soul, as is great wealth. It is not a sin to be rich,
but dangerous, though most of us are willing to take the risk.
Epictetus (Stob. 10) says: &ldquo;It is difficult for a rich person to
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
be right-minded or a right-minded person rich.&rdquo; Riches and
poverty are not essential criteria of character. Over against
the slums in our cities one may place the pious poor of Scotland,
as seen in &ldquo;The Cotter&rsquo;s Saturday Night.&rdquo; Over against
the wild and reckless <i>nouveaux riches</i> one may note the
generous givers of millions to missions and to education.</p>
<p>One must learn to be just to all classes and to do justice to
all. A person needs full knowledge of the social conditions
about him and the courage to apply the gospel of Christ to
these conditions. But let no one imagine that sociology can
take the place of the gospel of Jesus. Christianity is sociological,
but sociology is not necessarily Christian. We need intelligent
sympathy, but most of all we need the love and
grace of God in the heart. But minister and man must be independent
of bondage to either rich or poor and stand in the
freedom of Christ.</p>
<p>Prof. H. C. Vedder makes a very serious charge against
modern ministers: &ldquo;This attitude of the clergy can be explained
only on the ground of their economic dependence
upon the privileged classes. They are the hirelings of capitalism,
and, to do them justice, they earn their wages.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> This
is a bitter attack upon the ministry for always championing
the cause of capital whenever labor and capital clash. The
charge is not always true, as anyone who observes should
know. Organized labor is sometimes in the wrong. Corporations
that are unjust to labor are often denounced in the pulpit.
Let every case be met on its merits. Certainly the minister
of Christ should be on the side of manhood against mere
money. A man&rsquo;s life is more than money.</p>
<p>James reminds his readers that God is not ashamed of the
poor. In fact, he often calls the poor, as the world regards
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
them, to be rich in faith. After all, the riches of the spirit and
of fellowship with God are the true riches. So often a turn in
the wheel of life leaves a man poor today who was rich yesterday.
And death will separate one from all his wealth,
save what he has given away. The wicked rich man may
scout the poor saint here, but Lazarus will rest in Abraham&rsquo;s
bosom while the wicked rich man is in torment in hades.</p>
<p>But even here the pious poor stand high with God, while
the wicked rich are despised. The poor may be heirs of the
kingdom. Think of that&mdash;heirs of the kingdom of God, the
glorious messianic kingdom promised of old and now begun,
the fulness of which is in the future with God, the heavenly
kingdom. But even here and now the poor saint is a child of
the King and has riches untold. He has love and joy in his
heart, a superiority to adversity, an elevation of spirit, the
peace of God that passes all understanding; and that is
worth more than all the gold of Ophir.</p>
<p>It is not mere pious platitude on the part of James when he
writes thus. He is but interpreting the soul of mystic Christianity,
real Christianity, as set forth by Jesus in the Beatitudes,
where those only are felicitated who have the joy of
the spirit independent of outward condition or circumstance.
After all, the piety of the poor is a nation&rsquo;s best asset. The
poor will someday, many of them, be rich. May they still be
pious! The upper classes run down and run out, alas, and
have to be recruited constantly from the lower classes. It is
the law of life. If we save the masses, we may save the classes.
At any rate, it is a pitiful business to see a church of Jesus
Christ ashamed of the poor, as the world regards them, for
Jesus our Lord was himself poor for our sakes, voluntarily
poor. &ldquo;Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became
poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 8:9</span>)&mdash;rich
in God&rsquo;s mercy and grace, rich in character, in
likeness to Jesus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h3>The Royal Law (<span class="scripRef">2:8 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>The poise of James appears again. He has no wish to stir
the passions and prejudices of the poor against the rich.
Surely it is not a sin to love rich people. They are entitled to
the same love as other people, many far more because of the
noble use made of their wealth. If you really fulfil the royal
law&mdash;a law fit for kings or such as a king will be sure to follow
(cf. <span class="scripRef">Psalm 72</span>; <span class="scripRef">Zech. 9:9</span>) and supreme over other laws
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 22:40</span>)&mdash;you do well. We should love both rich and
poor alike. This royal law was in the Old Testament (<span class="scripRef">Lev. 19:18</span>)
and is here quoted. It was sanctioned by Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 19:18 f.</span>)
as one of the two chief commandments on which
hang the whole law and the prophets (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 22:38-40</span>). Love
of God and man covers all else. One may compare also the
Golden Rule as given by Jesus in <span class="scripRef">Matthew 7:12</span>, which is
just another way of stating the royal law of loving one&rsquo;s
neighbor (one near in need, whether in proximity or not) as
oneself, a very high standard for most people.</p>
<p>The royal law forbids the partiality in church of which
James has been speaking, this respect of persons. It is more
than an error of judgment or a breach of etiquette. It is an
act of sin, a slip in ethics, a missing of the mark that is fraught
with grave consequences. It is bad enough to be convicted by
the law as transgressors by this servile regard for the rich. It
is worse to note the evil effect on the church and the community.
A church of a clique is doomed. A church is only of
use when it is open to the people who need the help of the
gospel. The church opens its doors to let people in, does not
put up bars to keep them out.</p>
<h3>Stumbling in One Point (<span class="scripRef">2:10 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>At first blush it seems that James has Draconian severity in
these verses, but it is not the severe punishment of small
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
crimes or venial offenses. The long list of capital crimes in
ancient England shows how slowly men have learned to temper
justice with mercy. Some of the Stoics said that the theft
of a penny was as bad as parricide. The &ldquo;blue laws&rdquo; of Connecticut
come to mind also. James does not say that all sins
are equal, that one sin is as bad as another. As a matter of
fact, each man discounts his own sins. The rake looks with
scorn on the grafter. The man guilty of spiritual pride
scouts the drunkard. It is a hard task to convince a man that
he is guilty of his own sin.</p>
<p>The burden of the law was very heavy. The curse of the
law (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 3:13</span>) was more than violation of particular precepts,
though that was true to the last detail (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 11:26, 28, 32; 27:26</span>),
as Jesus explained (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:18 f.</span>). The Jewish
fathers put a hedge or fence about the law (<i>Pirke Aboth</i> i. 1)
and made it very difficult to keep all of it (the law as a whole,
hard enough as it was), plus the traditions of the elders,
which often contradicted and set at naught the commandment
of God (<span class="scripRef">Mark 7:8 f.</span>). Compare <span class="scripRef">Sirach 27:12</span>. Rabbi
Hunnah, in a midrash on <span class="scripRef">Numbers 5:14</span>, taught that he who
committed adultery broke all commandments, and some of
the rabbis placed the sabbath above all else and held that
if one profaned it, he had broken all the commandments.
Mayor, per contra, quotes some of the rabbis as saying that
to keep the law about fringes and phylacteries was to keep
the whole law. There was a constant tendency to make the
ceremonial cover up moral and spiritual lapses.</p>
<p>Augustine (Epistle to Jerome, 167) compares this teaching
of James with the Stoic doctrine of the solidarity of virtues
and vices as mentioned. But certainly James has a higher
view than these hair-splitting punctilios. Paul saw that the
essence of sin lies in the motive (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 14:23</span>) and that desire
to glorify God should pervade all our acts (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 10:31</span>).
It seems hard to hold someone who makes one slip to
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
strict account and hold him guilty of all. That is true only in
the sense that James proceeds to explain that any violation of
law makes one a lawbreaker.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
<p>One does not have to break all the laws to become a lawbreaker.
One offense places him in that category. The matter
is put with this sharp emphasis because of the complacent
self-satisfaction of the perfunctory ceremonialist (<span class="scripRef">James 1:26</span>),
who may yet commit the sin of partiality in church.
James is seeking to convict such &ldquo;pious&rdquo; sinners of their
guilt, to rouse them out of their smug self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that those who were guilty of spiritual
pride and other sins of the spirit boasted of their freedom
from adultery and murder (Hort). At any rate, we must not
forget that out of the heart are the issues of life, that murder
springs out of hate and that all of God&rsquo;s laws come from the
same will (Mayor). It is disobedience to the will of God that
constitutes the essence of sin. It is not a light matter to be
guilty of any sin. Our only hope is in the grace and forgiveness
of God. There is no room for pride on the part of sinners,
setting up one sin against another sin.</p>
<h3>A Law of Liberty (<span class="scripRef">2:12 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>But James is not a pharisaic legalist nor a Judaizer. He adds
these verses to make it plain that he does not have in mind
the painful observance of separate rules and details. The
spirit is greater than the letter. Our words and deeds are to
be judged by &ldquo;a law of liberty&rdquo; (cf. <span class="scripRef">1:25</span>), not of bondage.
We are under grace, not the old law. We live in an atmosphere
of love and liberty, not of repression and slavery. God
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
watches the real motive in our conduct toward the rich and
the poor as in all things. &ldquo;Mercy glorieth against judgment&rdquo;;
mercy triumphs over judgment. God shows mercy to us in
spite of our shortcomings, for Jesus is the pledge of our
fidelity and our hope.</p>
<p>We make so many mistakes that we should have no heart
to go on if we had to be held to strict account every time we
stumbled in one point. Still, we must not overlook the fact
that we did stumble. It is our duty not to stumble at that
point again. So we go on our stumbling way toward that
goal of perfection which is ever before us. It was Jesus who
said, &ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 7:1</span>). James
seems to know this saying, as he lays emphasis on the spirit
and motive in holy living.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII
<br />The Appeal to Life</h2>
<p>We now come to the famous passage that is supposed by
some scholars to be an attack on Paul&rsquo;s doctrine of salvation
by faith instead of works. James is interpreted by many to
be a champion of works as against Paul&rsquo;s theory of grace. It
is an old controversy and is the occasion of Martin Luther&rsquo;s
slighting allusion to the Epistle of James as &ldquo;a veritable epistle
of straw.&rdquo; He thought it contradicted the Epistle of Galatians,
which he loved dearly as his &ldquo;wife.&rdquo; It is necessary, therefore,
to clear the atmosphere a bit before proceeding to the
exposition.</p>
<h3>The Standpoint of James</h3>
<p>This depends on the date of the epistle. (For the discussion
of this question, see <a href="#c1">chapter I</a>.) It is here assumed that
James wrote before the Jerusalem Conference, before <span class="small">A.D.</span> 50.</p>
<p>Paul wrote Galatians and Romans, as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians,
in the heat of the Judaizing controversy, to answer
the contention that circumcision was essential to the salvation
of the Gentiles, that Christianity alone was not sufficient
but must be supplemented by Judaism. No issue ever stirred
Paul&rsquo;s nature like this. It is possible that Paul may have had in
mind a misuse of <span class="scripRef">James 2:14-26</span> by the Judaizers when he
wrote, knowing that James in reality agreed with him in the
matter (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15:14-21</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:1-10</span>). But James clearly is not
attacking Paul or Paul&rsquo;s theory of grace. He rather has in
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
view a perversion of the Christian emphasis on the spiritual
side as opposed to the ceremonial ritualism of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The pendulum swings from one extreme to the other. The
Jews had laid too much emphasis on religious duties (cf.
<span class="scripRef">James 1:26</span>), and some of the Christians went to the extreme
of thinking that no works at all were needed in the Christian
life. Some of the Jews, on the other hand, had already
gone so far as to consider creed alone essential. &ldquo;As soon as a
man has mastered the thirteen heads of the faith, firmly believing
therein ... though he may have sinned in every
possible way ... still he inherits eternal life.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> This Jewish
unconcern for real piety in life is reflected in the lives of some
of the Jewish Christians and is the occasion of the remarks of
James.</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s use of righteousness or justification is in the sense
of actual goodness as Jesus uses it in the Sermon on the
Mount (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:1</span>) and of sanctification as Paul has it in
Romans 6 to 8. It is not the &ldquo;imputed righteousness&rdquo; of Paul
in Romans 3 and 4. James has a practical purpose, not a
theological one. He is not discussing the question as to how
Abraham was set right with God, how faith was reckoned
as righteousness, the point seized on by Paul in the verse.
James quotes the whole verse (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 15:6</span>), as Paul does, but
he is concerned with it as proof that when put to the test,
Abraham lived up to his faith in that he actually &ldquo;offered up
Isaac his son upon the altar&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">James 2:21</span>). It is the deed as
proof of faith that James emphasizes, though both points are
in the narrative.</p>
<p>James looks upon works as proof of faith, not as means of
salvation. John the Baptist had demanded &ldquo;fruits worthy of
repentance&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 3:8</span>). Jesus had said, &ldquo;By their fruits ye
shall know them&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 7:20</span>). Paul will discuss death to sin
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
on the part of the believer (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 6:1-11</span>). Peter will show
how the life will make the calling and election sure (<span class="scripRef">2 Peter 1:10</span>).
The whole Epistle to the Hebrews is a clarion call to
hold fast the confession of faith to the end. John will insist
that those who say they are in the light do not walk in darkness
(<span class="scripRef">1 John 1:6; 2:9</span>). Certainly then, James is in harmony
with the full drift of the gospel message in his insistence
on works as proof of the new life.</p>
<p>Paul, in his contrast between faith and works, has in mind
the Jewish doctrine of works as means of salvation. See <span class="scripRef">2 Esdras 9:7 f.</span>:
&ldquo;Whoever shall be able to escape either by his
works or by his faith shall see my salvation.&rdquo; And even here
&ldquo;by faith&rdquo; does not mean what Paul has in mind, saving trust,
but rather creed. The Pharisees taught the value of works of
supererogation, the &ldquo;merit&rdquo; of the fathers, in particular, the
merit of Abraham, whose faith and works were a storehouse
for the Jews. &ldquo;We have Abraham to our father.&rdquo; That was
enough. So the Roman Catholics hold that the saints may
help us out of purgatory if we pay enough for their intercession.
Prayer itself becomes an <i>opus operatum</i>, a credit in the
balance sheet with God. Most Jews held works alone to
be the means of salvation. The point was keenly discussed in
the Jewish schools in Jerusalem and Alexandria.</p>
<p>As to faith, in this passage he is thinking of mere intellectual
assent to the unity of God or other theological tenets.
This was the use of &ldquo;faith&rdquo; by many of the Jews. After some
of them became Christians, they got no further. It is this
idle and empty faith that James is condemning. James does
have the other sense of trust for the word, as in <span class="scripRef">2:1</span>, &ldquo;faith in
our Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; the sense in which Paul uses the term
when he contrasts it with works (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 3:20-30</span>). It is quite
important to note this distinction.</p>
<p>The antithesis in James is not, in reality, between faith and
works but between live faith and dead faith, the two uses of
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the term just mentioned. In <span class="scripRef">verse 18</span> the point is made absolutely
clear. It is not personal trust in Christ that James
ridicules but an empty theological tenet that does not stand
the test of actual life. So then, James and Paul go off at
tangents when the same words occur, for they are talking
about different things.</p>
<h3>Not Pious Pretense (<span class="scripRef">2:14-17</span>)</h3>
<p>Once more James corrects a possible misapprehension. He
properly places mercy above justice, but no one need think
for a moment that good deeds do not matter. God is full of
mercy, but there is a limit even with God. He demands some
performance, not mere profession. &ldquo;What doth it profit?&rdquo;
James pointedly asks. <i>Cui bono?</i> What is the use? What good
is it for a man to say he has faith who has no works to prove
his faith? How can men know that he has any faith? The
mere assertion is all that men have at first. In the beginning
the claim to faith is accepted, but the life must confirm the
claim if men are to continue to believe it. God can read the
heart, but even God demands that the life show the change
of heart. The life must give expression to what the heart
has felt.</p>
<p>James asks again: &ldquo;Can that faith<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> save him?&rdquo; He does not
scoff at faith but at such hollow &ldquo;faith&rdquo; as this. James here
speaks for the practical man of the present day who wishes
to see some real difference in the life of a man who becomes
a Christian. It is an old demand, as we see in
<span class="scripRef">1 John 1 and 2</span>.
There is no escape from this appeal to life, nor ought there
to be. Men are judged by their conduct in business during
the week as much as by their attendance at church on Sunday.
James does not say that a Christian has no faults and
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
never sins or is a hypocrite if he sins once. He does say that
he should have some faith.</p>
<p>His illustration in <span class="scripRef">verses 15 and 16</span>
is very forcible and
shows that he was probably a striking and popular preacher
(Oesterley). It is a problem that is constantly presented to
our modern Christians and churches. A brother or sister is
in need of food and clothing. They are out of work because
of the economic conditions beyond their control. They are
not professional beggars. One may pause to admit the serious
difficulty of knowing how to render real assistance to those
who come to our doors for help. The modern social workers
tell us not to give money and clothing but to investigate
the case or to have the charity organization or some of the
rescue workers to do it for us. The great number of tramps
and professional beggars with false stories tends to harden
our hearts to the many cases of real need all about us. Some
of these are too proud to make their real condition known
and actually starve to death or perish from disease and cold.</p>
<p>James here assumes that the case is one of real need that
deserves sympathy and help. The man who prides himself
upon the correctness of his professional creed and pious
standing bestows kind words of sympathy and nothing else,
sending the suffering brother or sister, &ldquo;ill-clad and short of
daily food&rdquo; (Moffatt), out into the bitter cold and shutting
the door with a sense of satisfaction after such pious platitudes
as, &ldquo;Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled.&rdquo; He calls
his cheap words Christian sympathy. It is enough to make
demons laugh. The irony of James is keen. &ldquo;The things needful
to the body,&rdquo; the ordinary necessities of life, now become
rare luxuries to the poor brother or sister. So James repeats
his query: &ldquo;What doth it profit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is pertinent per contra to quote Paul on the necessity of
love even in beneficence: &ldquo;And if I bestow all my goods to
feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
not love, it profiteth me nothing&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 13:3</span>). What, indeed!
One recalls the compassion of Jesus for the hungry multitudes
whom he fed. His heart was not hardened. He did not
ask them to be satisfied with honeyed words and the aroma
of dinner. The pious pretenders actually think that the needy
should be grateful for kind advice when sent away without
a mouthful to eat. James applies his illustration to the point
discussed (<span class="scripRef">v. 17</span>). Mere professional faith that talks and
does not &ldquo;is dead in itself.&rdquo; There is no life in it, no reality.
It is dead on the inside and is a mere empty shell of pious
pretense. There are people who today turn to our churches
for help in the hour of need and get only empty words. It
will be in vain then to speak about the grace of God.</p>
<h3>Not Mere Intellectual Assent (<span class="scripRef">2:18-19</span>)</h3>
<p>It is extremely difficult to follow the thought of James in
<span class="scripRef">verse 18</span>. He is usually wonderfully perspicuous, but here
we are in doubt as to the punctuation and the reference in
&ldquo;a man.&rdquo; Some scholars think that it is a delicate way that
James has of referring to himself, but then James is emphasizing
works, not mere faith.</p>
<p>Is the sentence a question or an assertion? Shall we say
&ldquo;but&rdquo; or &ldquo;yea&rdquo;? Hort has shown a way out that is partly followed
by Moffatt. Take the &ldquo;man&rdquo; as an objector, but let
his objection cover only the first sentence, the point being to
challenge the faith of James, since he has put such accent on
works. &ldquo;Thou, James, hast thou faith? I also (as well as thou)
have works.&rdquo; The objector thus claims to have both faith and
works but implies that James has only works and no faith.</p>
<p>The rest of the verse is then the reply of James to the
objector.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> James bursts in with the answer to the challenge
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
and rests his claim to faith on works as proof. &ldquo;Show me thy
faith apart from thy works, and I by my works will show thee
my faith.&rdquo; Here James pits over against each other the two
sorts of faith&mdash;the true faith which James claims to possess
and which is proved by works and the false faith which
is mere profession and entirely apart from works. The antithesis
is complete. The dispute turns on how one knows
that he has faith. James rests his case on his works and in turn
challenges the objector to prove his faith apart from works.</p>
<p>Now James is ready to drive the point home. He proceeds
to show that such an empty faith as his objector has is mere
intellectual assent to propositions and is not saving trust that
bears fruit in the life. &ldquo;Thou believest that God is one.&rdquo;
This is one of the statements of the unity of God. The usual
formula occurs in <span class="scripRef">Deuteronomy 6:4</span> and in <span class="scripRef">Mark 12:29</span>
(&ldquo;The Lord our God, the Lord is one&rdquo;). The recitation of this
phrase was not merely the orthodox creed but was supposed
to have saving efficacy (cf. the Moslem repetition of
&ldquo;Allah&rdquo;). From the time of the exile the repetition of the
<i>Shema</i> (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 6:4 ff.</span>) each morning and evening was
the duty of every pious Israelite. &ldquo;Whoever reads the <i>Shema</i>
upon his couch is as one that defends himself with a two-edged
sword&rdquo; (Meg. 3<i>a</i>). &ldquo;They cool the flames of Gehinnom
for him who reads the <i>Shema</i>&rdquo; (Ber. 15<i>b</i>). Oesterley (<i>in
loco</i>) adds that &ldquo;the very parchment on which the <i>Shema</i>
is written is efficacious in keeping demons at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These statements will help us to understand the atmosphere
from which James draws his illustration. And yet
James does not ridicule this mental assent to the oneness of
God. &ldquo;Thou doest well.&rdquo; Orthodoxy is better than heresy.
Orthodoxy is &ldquo;thinking straight,&rdquo; and that is what we all
need to do. Every man is right in his own eyes, and the rest
are a bit &ldquo;off.&rdquo; But good as monotheism is, it is not enough
(cf. Mohammedanism again).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>What James criticizes is mere intellectual assent with no
vital union with God. &ldquo;The demons also believe,&rdquo; as well as
you. The demons know only too well that God is and that he
is one. They are monotheists, not polytheists. They recognized
Jesus: &ldquo;What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth?
art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
art, the Holy One of God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 1:24</span>). Compare <span class="scripRef">Matthew 8:29</span>
and <span class="scripRef">Luke 4:41</span>. The demons are thoroughly orthodox
on this point, have intellectual assent (&ldquo;faith&rdquo;), but they are
still demons. They even shudder at the fact and the power
of God as they feared Jesus (<span class="scripRef">Mark 1:24</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 8:29</span>). The
word means to &ldquo;bristle,&rdquo; like the Latin <i>horreo</i>, with the hair
standing on end. &ldquo;Then a spirit passed before my face; the
hair of my flesh stood up&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Job 4:15</span>). So Daniel (<span class="scripRef">7:15</span>) says,
&ldquo;My spirit was grieved.&rdquo; The argument is as complete as it
can be.</p>
<h3>The Obedient Trust of Abraham (<span class="scripRef">2:20-24</span>)</h3>
<p>But James applies his illustration again. He hammers the
objector while he has him. &ldquo;But wilt thou know, O vain
man?&rdquo; (&ldquo;you senseless fellow,&rdquo; Moffatt). The word is used
like the Latin <i>vanus</i> of boasters or impostors, men whose
word cannot be depended upon. You can know, if you wish
to know,<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> &ldquo;that faith apart from works is barren,&rdquo; &ldquo;faith without
deeds is dead&rdquo; (Moffatt), according to some manuscripts.
One may note <span class="scripRef">2 Peter 1:8</span>, &ldquo;not idle nor unfruitful.&rdquo;
Faith without works is like a barren woman, without children
to comfort her. &ldquo;Children&rdquo; and &ldquo;works&rdquo; are sometimes
used as parallel. &ldquo;Wisdom is justified by her works&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 11:19</span>);
&ldquo;wisdom is justified of all her children&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 7:35</span>).</p>
<p>James thus shows irritation at the dulness of his objector,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
but he hopes to make even such a man see the point by appealing
to the axiomatic case of Abraham. The faith of Abraham
was one of the commonplaces of theological discussion
in the rabbinical schools (Oesterley). See <span class="scripRef">Sirach 44:20 ff.</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Wisdom 10:5</span>. It is no wonder that Paul (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 4</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 3:7</span>)
makes use of the case of Abraham. He considers it so important
that in Romans he devotes a whole chapter to the subject.
Paul lays chief emphasis (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 4:17-21</span>) on Abraham&rsquo;s
faith in the promise of a son. Paul also proves that Abraham
had the justifying faith before he was circumcised. James
shows that Abraham lived up to his faith when put to the
test. Both points are true.</p>
<p>There was abuse of the faith of Abraham. Thus Rabbi
Nehemiah (<i>Mechilta</i> on <span class="scripRef">Ex. 14:31</span>) says: &ldquo;So Abraham,
solely for the merit of his faith, whereby he believed in the
Lord, inherited this world and the other.&rdquo; The Jews came to
rely so much on the &ldquo;merit&rdquo; of Abraham&rsquo;s faith that they
felt that all they had to do was to say, &ldquo;We have Abraham to
our father&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 3:9</span>). They leaned<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> on &ldquo;Father Abraham.&rdquo;
In <span class="scripRef">1 Maccabees 2:52</span> the same use is made of the case of
Abraham that we have in James: &ldquo;Was not Abraham found
faithful in trial, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness?&rdquo;
In <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 11</span> the same exposition of faith is set forth
by the glorious list of heroes who exemplified faith. Among
these heroes is Abraham, who obeyed to go out (<span class="scripRef">11:8</span>) to
a distant land and who offered up his only begotten son
(<span class="scripRef">11:17</span>).</p>
<p>James appeals confidently, therefore, to the example of
Abraham in offering up Isaac upon the altar (cf. <span class="scripRef">Gen. 22:9</span>).
He had shown that he served God from love and not merely
from fear. His faith had stood the severest of all tests&mdash;believing
that God would go with him down into the darkness
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
of death and make plain his command that was so hard to
obey.</p>
<p>James interprets the case of Abraham with his usual pungency.
&ldquo;Thou seest,&rdquo; or at least, &ldquo;thou oughtest to see.&rdquo; The
deduction is inevitable. &ldquo;Faith wrought with his works,&rdquo;
&ldquo;faith cooperated with deeds&rdquo; (Moffatt), just the opposite of
&ldquo;apart from works.&rdquo; It is thus clear that James did not mean
to say that Abraham had only works and not faith. It is faith
and works with Abraham, as he had contended in <span class="scripRef">verse 18</span>.
It is like Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;faith working through love,&rdquo; energetic faith.
So James adds: &ldquo;by works was faith made perfect,&rdquo; &ldquo;completed
by deeds&rdquo; (Moffatt).</p>
<p>Thus with Abraham faith was shown to be alive, not dead;
fruitful, not barren; brought to a good result or end, not cut
short with mere profession or promise. So the Scripture was
fulfilled (made full or complete) in the case of Abraham:
&ldquo;And Abraham believed God, and it [the faith] was reckoned
[set down to his credit] unto him for righteousness.&rdquo;
Paul in <span class="scripRef">Romans 4</span> lays emphasis on the verb &ldquo;believed,&rdquo; and
James stresses the obedience which proves the reality of the
trust.</p>
<p>Both points are justly made. In each instance faith precedes
the works. We are set right with God by trust, but the
life must correspond to the new relation with God. It was so
with Abraham. He was called &ldquo;the friend of God.&rdquo; Compare
<span class="scripRef">2 Chronicles 20:7</span>. &ldquo;Shall I hide from Abraham that which I
do?&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 18:17</span>). With the Arabs the term &ldquo;Khalil Allah&rdquo;
(Friend of God) is the current name for Abraham. Epictetus
(bk. II, chap, xvii, &sect; 29) speaks of looking &ldquo;up into heaven as
the friend of God.&rdquo; Plato calls the righteous man &ldquo;on terms
of friendship with God.&rdquo; Jesus calls his disciples &ldquo;friends,&rdquo;
no longer &ldquo;servants,&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">John 15:14 f.</span> There cannot be such
friendship without trust of the most absolute kind, a trust
that means loyalty to the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>One must not think that James discredits faith. He does
not. He assumes the need of it. In <span class="scripRef">verse 24</span> James uses &ldquo;justified&rdquo;
more in the sense of final approval (set right at last)
than of the initial restoration of peace with God. And even
so &ldquo;the faith as a ground of justification is assumed as a starting
point&rdquo; (Hort).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; says James, leaving his imaginary opponent and
turning again to his readers. They can see the point, whether
the empty-headed disputant does or not. It is hard for a
controversialist to see anything but his own side of the question.
It is &ldquo;not only by faith&rdquo; that a man is justified. The case
of Abraham shows that works must follow faith in the natural
order of grace. James has administered a severe rebuke to the
antinomians who deny any responsibility for holy living
and disclaim the force of the moral law. There has always
been a curious type of pietism that runs easily into immorality
with no compunctions of conscience, a sort of emotionalism
without ethical tone or flavor. Abraham was not simply the
father of the Jewish people but the father of all the spiritual
Israel&mdash;the believing children of God in all the ages since,
who form the elect of God and of the earth.</p>
<h3>The Case of Rahab (<span class="scripRef">2:25</span>)</h3>
<p>One wonders why James selects a case like this after speaking
of Abraham, the father of the fruitful and God&rsquo;s friend.
Oesterley doubts how this verse could come from the pen of
a Christian. But James may have wished to select another
example at the furthest possible point from Abraham, a
heathen and a proselyte, &ldquo;the first of all the proselytes&rdquo; in
the land of Canaan (Hort). Certainly if a woman like
Rahab could be saved, no one else need despair. She expressed
her faith in God: &ldquo;I know that the Lord hath given
you the land ... the Lord your God, he is God in heaven
above, and in earth beneath&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Josh. 2:9, 11</span>, AV). Besides,
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
she showed her courage by avowing the cause of Jehovah
and of Israel, by protecting the messengers (spies, in reality),
and by a life of uprightness thereafter.</p>
<p>It was a crisis in the history of Israel as they came to
Jericho, and Rahab took her stand for God at the start; hence
the high honor accorded her. She is mentioned in <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 11:31</span>
in the famous list of heroes of faith. In <span class="scripRef">Matthew 1:5</span>
she appears in the genealogy of Christ. She was counted one
of the four chief beauties of Israel along with Sarah, Abigail,
and Esther (Mayor). &ldquo;Eight prophets who were also priests
are descended from the harlot Rahab&rdquo; (<i>Megilla</i> 14<i>b</i>). Certainly
there is no desire in James nor in Hebrews to dignify
her infamous trade, which she renounced, but only to single
her out as a brand snatched from the burning by the power
of God.</p>
<h3>The Union of Faith and Works (<span class="scripRef">2:26</span>)</h3>
<p>This is what James pleads for, not the divorce between
creed and conduct, which is alas only too prevalent even
today. There should be an indissoluble marriage between
faith and works, a union as close as that between spirit and
body. &ldquo;For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so
faith apart from works is dead.&rdquo; By &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; here James means
simply the breath of life, without which the body is dead.
&ldquo;False faith is virtually a corpse&rdquo; (Hort).</p>
<p>By this striking paradox James attacks the root of the
whole matter and has his last word on the subject. Hort remarks
that James by the use of the phrase &ldquo;justified by
works&rdquo; seems to be answering Paul in <span class="scripRef">Romans 4:2</span> or a misuse
of Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;justified by faith&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 5:1</span>), though he does
not see how James could have seen Paul. I have already expressed
my own conviction that James and Paul are not
really answering one another. They are discussing different
aspects of the subject and touch only at points and go off
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
along other lines. In all probability each would agree to
the statements of the other if the language of each were put
in the proper perspective. Certainly they agreed when they
were together in Jerusalem (<span class="scripRef">Acts 15</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 2:1-10</span>). But it is
important for us that our faith shall be real and vital, not
hollow and dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII
<br />The Tongues of Teachers</h2>
<p>James carries on the discussion of &ldquo;slow to speak&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1:19</span>).
He has just been writing about idle faith in <span class="scripRef">2:14-26</span>, and now
he proceeds (Plummer) to expound the peril of the idle
word, &ldquo;wrong speech after wrong action&rdquo; (Hort). Indeed, in
<span class="scripRef">1:26</span> he has already mentioned the failure to bridle the
tongue as a sure sign of vain religion. Now he expands the
matter in a remarkable paragraph.</p>
<p>The transition is thus not so abrupt as at first seems to be
the case, and apparently from the first he planned this discussion
of the tongue. Probably it comes here (Plummer)
because controversies about faith and works were already
rife. Here James speaks &ldquo;against those who substitute words
for works&rdquo; (Plummer), a rather large class. &ldquo;In noble uprightness,
he values only the strict practice of concrete
duties, and hates talk&rdquo; (Reuss), if it is <i>only</i> talk. James has
the gift of condensation. He can write on talk without taking
twenty volumes, like Carlyle, to prove that if speech is silvern,
silence is golden (Plummer). The &ldquo;overvaluation of theory
as compared with practice&rdquo; (Mayor) condemned in chapter
II is still present with James as he discusses the tongue.</p>
<h3>An Oversupply of Teachers (<span class="scripRef">3:1a</span>)</h3>
<p>We are not here to think simply of official teachers like
Paul&rsquo;s apostles, prophets, teachers (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 12:28 f.</span>; <span class="scripRef">Eph. 4:11</span>).
In the Didache (<span class="scripRef">xiii. 2, xv. 1, 2</span>) teachers are placed
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
on a par with prophets and higher than bishops and deacons.
There is no doubt that teaching received tremendous emphasis
in the work of the early Christians. Jesus is the great
Teacher of the ages and is usually presented as teaching. In
the Jewish &ldquo;houses of learning&rdquo; (synagogues) teaching was
as prominent an element as worship. The official teachers
passed away, and the modern Sunday school movement is
an effort to restore the teaching function in the churches.</p>
<p>The true preacher should be a teacher also, but many
preachers are more evangelistic and hortatory than didactic.
The best preachers combine all these elements and build up
the saints in the faith to which they have been won. The
mission work of modern Christianity also has had to lay new
emphasis on the educational side of Christian effort. There
is no reason why the morning service in public worship
should not be a teaching service and the evening service
more evangelistic. Teachers are necessary. People &ldquo;having
itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own
lusts&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 4:3</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> Epictetus (bk. III, chap, xxiii, &sect; 29)
says: Rufus &ldquo;used to speak in such a way that each of us as
we sat thought that someone had accused us to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But James here is thinking of the unofficial teachers in the
churches. In the Jewish synagogues there was wide latitude
allowed for strangers and others to speak. Jesus took advantage
of this opportunity and taught freely in the synagogues
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:9 ff.</span>; <span class="scripRef">Mark 1:39</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 6:6 ff.</span>). There would be
interruption and violent opposition at times (cf. <span class="scripRef">John 6:59-66</span>).
Paul used the courtesy to strangers to speak in the Jewish
synagogues and met with open opposition at times (cf.
<span class="scripRef">Acts 13:15, 45; 18:6</span>).</p>
<p>In Corinth we have a striking instance of the evil of promiscuous
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
teaching, unrestrained and unregulated (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 14</span>).
It became necessary for Paul to rebuke the church for
unseemly disorder. There were many who were only too
ready to be carried away by any newfangled doctrine.
There is safety in free discussion, which acts as a safety valve
and also leaves a deposit of truth. But the acrimonious spirit
had a fine opportunity to display itself. Men of arrogant convictions
and little knowledge felt that they &ldquo;had no need to
learn anything from their brethren, but were fully equipped
as teachers&rdquo; (Johnstone), &ldquo;desiring to be teachers of the law,
though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof
they confidently affirm&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 1:7</span>).</p>
<p>Some men with a certain fluency of speech really had no
message and only spoke out of vanity and really &ldquo;thought
more of the admiration which they might excite by a display
of their powers than of the light and strength which through
Gods grace they might give their brethren&rdquo; (Dale). Evidently
James is here concerned with these promiscuous, officious,
irresponsible, self-appointed teachers, men with a
cocksure explanation of all difficulties, not afraid to rush
in where angels fear to tread.</p>
<p>The world was full of roving teachers with every sort of
patent ism to dispense to the public. Both Jews and Athenians
were eager for something newer than the last stale
theory (the very latest fad). The synagogues of the Jews and
the churches of the Christians offered a fine platform for
these cranks to air their notions. Besides, some of the best of
men, earnest Christians, have a &ldquo;lust for talk&rdquo; (W. Robertson
Nicoll) that leads them into all sorts of excesses.</p>
<p>James, therefore, is pleading for restraint and moderation
when he says, &ldquo;Be not many of you teachers,&rdquo; &ldquo;do not swell
the ranks of the teachers&rdquo; (Moffatt). Teachers are absolutely
necessary, but the thing can be overdone. Some learners
(disciples) are needed. Liberty within reasonable limits
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
must be allowed, but not rank license. Men must not be too
eager to teach what they do not know.</p>
<p>There is no danger of an oversupply of well-equipped
teachers, who are masters of the message of Christ. There are
still too many who are incompetent, and therefore the accent
on teacher-training in the Sunday schools is most timely. The
caution of James is pertinent today, but we must not discourage
timid souls who can learn to teach and who ought
to undertake it. The greatness of the teacher&rsquo;s task must not
be overlooked. James warns us against its abuse. There is a
mental sloth that is as bad as this eagerness to be teachers, a
lazy satisfaction with the elements of Christianity and failure
to grow into the position of teachers of the doctrines of
grace, continuing as babes unable to digest solid food (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 5:12</span>).</p>
<h3>The Peril of Teachers (<span class="scripRef">3:1b</span>)</h3>
<p>Teaching has to be done. There is no escape from that, but
those who teach must understand their responsibility. They
are doctors (from <i>doceo</i>, to teach) of the mind and heart.
They cannot escape their responsibility as spiritual surgeons,
for they deal with the issues of life and death, &ldquo;knowing that
we shall receive heavier judgment.&rdquo; In seasons of religious
excitement it is particularly desirable that men shall bear
this fact in mind. There is danger for the teacher and for
those that hear and are led astray by foolish talk.</p>
<p>Feeling was probably running high in some of the
churches, and there was occasion for the sobering words of
James. &ldquo;The penalty of untruth is untruth, to imbibe which
is death&rdquo; (Taylor). One has only to recall the words of
Jesus: &ldquo;And I say unto you, that every idle word that men
shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of
judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by
thy words thou shalt be condemned&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:36 f.</span>). It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
easy to be overconfident, like the complacency of the Jews
of whom Paul said that each was confident that he was &ldquo;a
corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 2:20</span>).
&ldquo;Blind leaders of the blind&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 15:14</span>) are they. It is bad
enough to break one of the least commandments, but whoever
does &ldquo;and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:19</span>).</p>
<p>There is no escaping the fact that a heavier penalty rests
on preachers and teachers who leave a trail of error behind
them. This point of view explains Paul&rsquo;s anxiety in the pastoral
epistles for the future of Christianity, as it had to confront
Pharisaism, Gnosticism, Mithraism, the emperor cult,
and the hundred and one vagaries of the age. Certainly a
teacher must speak his mind. He must be intellectually honest
and tell what he sees, but he is not called upon to give his
guesses at truth as truth. He ought to be interesting if he can,
but not at the expense of truth. Freedom of teaching is quite
consonant with fidelity to truth. One does not have to be a
mere traditionalist in order to escape wild speculation. He
must bring forth things new and old if they are true.</p>
<p>The severest words that fell from the lips of Jesus are
against the Pharisees who filled the place of teachers for the
Jews but who &ldquo;say, and do not,&rdquo; who &ldquo;sit on Moses&rsquo; seat&rdquo; as
authoritative teachers and yet &ldquo;strain out the gnat, and
swallow the camel&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 23:2-3, 24</span>). &ldquo;Woe unto you lawyers!
for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not
in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Luke 11:52</span>). The child was kept in the dark while at school
because the teacher did not let in the light. &ldquo;The hungry
sheep look up and are not fed.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Test of Perfection (<span class="scripRef">3:2a</span>)</h3>
<p>Others besides teachers have pitfalls, for teachers are not
the only errant men. &ldquo;For in many things we all stumble.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
James includes himself in this category. The Vulgate reads
&ldquo;ye&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">verse 1</span> (<i>sumitis</i>), not willing to admit that James
ran any risk about the heavier judgment; but that is not the
correct text. James shows no disposition to exempt himself.
One and all we make many slips, stumble over something in
the path. Our falls are only too frequent. Who is the perfect
man? Seneca (Clem. 1:6) says, &ldquo;We all sin&rdquo; (<i>peccamus
omnes</i>). But Epictetus (bk. IV, chap. iv, &sect; 7) uses the word
for sin for merely &ldquo;commit a fault.&rdquo; He has a weak conception
of sin. Epictetus also (bk. I, chap. xxviii, &sect; 23) says, &ldquo;No
man stumbles on account of another&rsquo;s action.&rdquo; But surely he
is in error here.</p>
<p>Teachers are particularly liable to stumble in speech, for
precisely in that sphere their activity lies (Plummer). This
point is common to all. Most assuredly, all men are guilty of
sins of speech. Each one is sure to stumble there sooner or
later. This is a very easy test of one&rsquo;s perfection. He can be
prodded by the tongue. &ldquo;The scribes and the Pharisees began
to press upon him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak
of many things; laying wait [ambush] for him, to catch
[as if wild game] something out of his mouth&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 11: 53 f.</span>).
Yes, but they were all the more angry when the one
perfect Man kept control of his tongue.</p>
<p>Smart lawyers often try to trip a witness in his talk. It is
hard to be consistent in talk, true in talk, clean in speech.
&ldquo;If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man,&rdquo;
&ldquo;whoever avoids slips of speech is a perfect man&rdquo; (Moffatt).
&ldquo;Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Prov. 6:2</span>).
Compare <span class="scripRef">Sirach 28:12-26</span> for pungent remarks on speech.
&ldquo;That which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the
man&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 15:11</span>). The chemical reaction to talk is a test
that we cannot refuse. Teachers cannot escape this inevitable
test. The rest of this discussion consists of a series of remarkable
illustrations of the power of the tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h3>The Bridle and the Horse (<span class="scripRef">3:2b-3</span>)</h3>
<p>The man who does control his tongue is able to bridle the
whole body also (cf. <span class="scripRef">1:26</span>), for the body goes with the
tongue. In fact, nothing is commoner than for one to make
a rash statement and then feel compelled to stand by it for
the sake of imaginary consistency. Hort keenly observes that
the force of &ldquo;also&rdquo; after &ldquo;the whole body&rdquo; is that a man who
can bridle his tongue can bridle his whole body. The tongue
is a real Bucephalus, and it takes an Alexander to master him.
It is really wonderful how a spirited, impetuous horse can be
subdued by bit and bridle. The spirit does not go out of the
horse, but his restless energy is under control and guidance.</p>
<p>James does not mean that a man should be dumb and
lifeless, without ambition and power, but simply that his
tongue, like all the rest of the body, should be kept in control.
This figure of bridling the tongue, as already noted
(<span class="scripRef">1:26</span>), is one of the most vivid figures in all languages.
David said: &ldquo;I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with
my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 39:1</span>).</p>
<p>It is not merely that the tongue is so hard to put a bridle on
but also that the tongue has such an influence on the whole body, able thus
to lead the body by the bridle.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a>
The horse has to follow his mouth, in which the bridle is placed. The
purpose of the bridle is that the horses may obey us, and it is
thoroughly successful, as a rule. &ldquo;We turn about their whole
body also&rdquo; along with the mouth. So we should place bridles
in our mouths for the deliberate purpose of controlling the
tongue. It will not happen by accident.</p>
<p>We are to repress the impulsive and petulant word.
Thus we train our own tongues and make it easier to subdue
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the other members of the body. One member cannot be allowed
to lead the whole body into sin. Pluck it out, if it be the
right eye or the right hand (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:29</span>). The members of the
body are all so related as to be affected by what the others
experience. &ldquo;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need
of thee&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 12:21</span>). Without this bridle on the tongue
there is no true self-control. A tongue loose at both ends
means a man whom everyone shuns as a nuisance. If the
bridle is good for the horse, it is far more so for the man. The
difference is that the man has to put the bridle into his own
mouth and in dual capacity as rider and horse master himself,
the most unmanageable of steeds.</p>
<p>A garrulous man is a bore at best, while a woman with a
sharp tongue is a terror to the community. Tell no secrets to
a talkative man, and few to anyone save your wife. A man
who talks to hear himself talk will be sure to tell what he
ought not to say. The writer of Hebrews refuses to go on with
too many details about his heroes of faith, &ldquo;for the time will
fail me if I tell&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 11:32</span>), &ldquo;time will leave me telling.&rdquo;
If the audience held the bridle, the preacher might stop
sooner. The phonograph can be turned off at will, permitting
only so much &ldquo;canned&rdquo; talk at a time. And yet talk is one of
the most delightful things in all the world. But there can be
too much of a good thing, if, forsooth, it is good. There are
few greater nuisances than the interrupter, who breaks into
a conversation with no regard for the courtesies of the occasion.
He is as bad as the man who monopolizes the conversation
and allows no one else to talk at all. He needs a
stopper, not a bridle, in his mouth.</p>
<h3>The Rudder and the Ship (<span class="scripRef">3:4</span>)</h3>
<p>With great wealth of imagination James proceeds to illustrate
still further the power of the tongue over the rest of
the body. The point is clear from the illustration of the bridle
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
and the horse, but it is made still clearer by the other figures.
The importance of the subject justifies this piling up of
metaphors. &ldquo;This combination of the horse&rsquo;s bridle and the
ship&rsquo;s rudder as illustrative of the tongue is found&rdquo; (Hort)
in Philo and Plutarch. &ldquo;The argument is <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> from the
horse to the man, and still more from the ship to the man, so
that the whole forms a climax, the point being throughout
the same, namely, the smallness of the part to be controlled
in order to have control over the whole&rdquo; (Plummer).</p>
<p>The horse is an irrational creature and yet can be managed
by the bridle. The ship has no mind at all and yet is
moved &ldquo;by a very small rudder,&rdquo; &ldquo;turned about,&rdquo; &ldquo;whither
the impulse of the steersman willeth.&rdquo; The &ldquo;impulse&rdquo; may be
like &ldquo;the rush of water&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">Proverbs 21:1</span>, which is there compared
to the king&rsquo;s heart, for God &ldquo;turneth it whithersoever
he will,&rdquo; or like the rush or onset of the Gentiles and Jews
to injure Paul in Iconium (<span class="scripRef">Acts 14:5</span>). Here it is the gentle
pressure or touch of the hand of the steersman who guides
the ship on its course straight ahead, as he decides (intention,
purpose rather than mere will).<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></p>
<p>The complete mastery of the steersman over the ship is accented
by a comparison of the size of the ancient boats with
horses. &ldquo;Behold, even the ships&rdquo; (probably we are to translate
&ldquo;even&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;also&rdquo;), which, though they are so
great (cf. <span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 1:10</span>), &ldquo;are yet turned about by the impulse
of the steersman,&rdquo; even when they are being driven by rough
winds (if here again we translate &ldquo;even&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;also&rdquo;).
One is reminded of the boat in which Jesus and the disciples
were crossing the Sea of Galilee &ldquo;now in the midst of the sea,
distressed by the waves&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 14:24</span>). The &ldquo;rough winds&rdquo;
(cf. <span class="scripRef">Prov. 27:16</span>), &ldquo;stiff winds&rdquo; (Moffatt), were particularly
dangerous for the small (from our standpoint) ships of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
ancients. But the steersman could hold to his course even
over a rough sea.</p>
<p>The point of James about the size of the ships would apply
with far more force today, when modern leviathans of the
deep plow the waters. There is now less peril from the stiff
winds, but there is all the more ground for wonder that the
tiny rudder can control at will the giant of the ocean. The
steersman can drive the mighty monster straight upon an
iceberg and sink it in a few minutes, as in the crash of the
<i>Titanic</i>. Great as the ship is, the silent forces of nature are
still greater. Man has not yet mastered all the powers of nature.
But the ship, blind to its fate, responded to the will of
the steersman, who dashed against the iceberg.</p>
<p>The lesson is only too obvious. One must watch the tongue
if he is to avoid shipwreck. The tongue may dash the whole
life in blind rage against God. The ship is one of the most
beautiful of objects as it rides the waves in proud majesty.
But more beautiful still is a life that is not marred by bad or
bitter words. Plutarch (<i>De Garrulitate</i>, 10) says that speech
beyond control is like a ship out at sea, broken loose from its
moorings.</p>
<h3>The Fire and the Forest (<span class="scripRef">3:5 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>The power of the tongue over the body in general is shown
by the bridle and the rudder. Now the power of the tongue
for evil is specifically illustrated by the metaphor of fire.
True, the tongue is a little member, and yet it &ldquo;boasteth
great things,&rdquo; &ldquo;can boast of great exploits&rdquo; (Moffatt).</p>
<p>It is not a mere empty boast that the tongue can make. It
is hard to exaggerate the power of the tongue, which is able
to sway great multitudes for good or ill, to stir the wildest
passions of man to uncontrollable fury, or to exalt men to the
highest emotions of their natures. The tongue can soothe the
dying or damn the living. The tongue can sing like a songbird
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
or growl like a lion. The tongue can speak words of
tenderest love or of venomous hate. It can speak like a
megaphone in trumpet tones or in a whisper almost inaudible
save to an eager ear. Plummer tells the story of
Amasis, king of Egypt, who sent a sacrifice to Bias the sage
with the request that he send back the best part and the
worst. He sent back the tongue.</p>
<p>James adds, &ldquo;Behold, how much wood is kindled by how
small a fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;what a forest is set ablaze by a little spark of
fire&rdquo; (Moffatt). The figure is that of timber or woodland
rather than a pile of wood. Mayor quotes Milton: &ldquo;Into what
pit thou seest from what height fallen.&rdquo; The inflammatory
Oriental audience with the high pitch of voice, confusion of
tongues, and wild gesticulation is aptly compared to a forest
fire (Oesterley).<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>
<p>There is pathos in the dreadful forest fires that annually
devastate our country. The damage each year amounts to
several hundred millions of dollars, besides the injury to
future generations in the loss of the blessings in many ways
from the forests. In most instances these forest fires, which
rage with uncontrollable fury when the wind gets up, are
due to accident or mischief. A spark from an engine, a cigarette
thrown in the leaves, a burning match cast to one side
by a hunter, a smoldering campfire, a shot from a gun&mdash;these
and other like causes explain most of the conflagrations.</p>
<p>The situation is so serious that the national government has
a fire patrol to guard the forest reserves. Once a prairie fire
starts there is hardly any stopping it till it burns out. Mice
and matches cause over twelve hundred fires each year in
New York City. Only a start is needed, a start long enough
to get beyond control, and we have the horrible holocausts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Chicago, Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco. &ldquo;A burning fire
kindles many heaps of corn&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Sir. 11:32</span>). The scholiast on
this verse adds, &ldquo;There is nothing which more devastates
the world than an evil tongue.&rdquo; Nero set fire to Rome to see
the grandeur of the spectacle, and he fiddled while the city
burned. Similar irresponsibility is seen often in the reckless
use of the tongue. We should not light a fire which can
blaze beyond our control.</p>
<p>So James adds, &ldquo;And the tongue is a fire.&rdquo; See <span class="scripRef">Proverbs 16:27</span>,
&ldquo;And in his lips there is a scorching fire.&rdquo; Compare
<span class="scripRef">Sirach 28:21-23</span>. &ldquo;The effect is that of an underground flame,
concealed for a while, then breaking out afresh&rdquo; (Carr). Indeed,
&ldquo;the world of iniquity among our members is the
tongue,&rdquo; &ldquo;the tongue proves a very world of mischief among
our members&rdquo; (Moffatt). The tongue was made for good use
and in itself is good, but it has been prostituted to evil. So
here the very word for &ldquo;is&rdquo; (cf. <span class="scripRef">4:4</span>, &ldquo;maketh himself&rdquo;) brings
out this distinction. The tongue &ldquo;is constituted&rdquo; so, is not so
by nature. Now we say that a man&rsquo;s tongue has run away
with him. The tongue has made a career for itself, &ldquo;the
world [realm] of iniquity,&rdquo; &ldquo;the unrighteous world&rdquo; (Hort).
It was made the best of members but has run riot till it has
become the personification of injustice and all sorts of wrong.
The Vulgate has it here <i>universitas iniquitatis</i> rather than
<i>mundus</i>. One thinks of our use of &ldquo;university,&rdquo; a world in itself
for good or ill.</p>
<p>Jesus spoke of &ldquo;the mammon of unrighteousness,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
judge of unrighteousness.&rdquo; So the tongue represents the
world of iniquity and has become &ldquo;the chief channel of temptation
from man to man&rdquo; (Mayor). &ldquo;They set their mouth
against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the
earth&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 73:9</span>, AV). This microcosm epitomizes the
macrocosm of evil. Bengel has it <i>a macrocosmo ad microcosmum</i>.
The evil wrought by the tongue ramifies through
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
the whole of society and goes on and on in its deadly influence.</p>
<p>It &ldquo;defiles the whole body,&rdquo; &ldquo;staining the whole of the
body&rdquo; (Moffatt).<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> The Vulgate has <i>maculat</i>. Jesus had said,
&ldquo;That which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the
man&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 15:11</span>). At first James seems to overstate the
matter, but modern science reinforces his point. It is now
known that angry words cause the glands of the body to discharge
a dangerous poison that affects the stomach, the
heart, the brain. The effect is usually temporary but sometimes
fatal. It is literally true that such choler defiles the
whole body. Hate has the same effect. The chameleon
changes color according to its emotions and environment.
The tongue not only commits evil by lying, by defending sin,
and by leading to sin, but it leaves a deadly stain in the very
body and soul of the one who misuses it. &ldquo;It is the palmary instance
of the principle that the best when perverted becomes
the worst&mdash;<i>corruptio optimi fit pessima</i>&rdquo; (Plummer).</p>
<p>The tongue &ldquo;setteth on fire the wheel of nature,&rdquo; &ldquo;setting
fire to the round circle of existence&rdquo; (Moffatt), &ldquo;the whole
circle of innate passions&rdquo; (Oesterley), &ldquo;the wheel of man&rsquo;s
creation&rdquo; (Hort, who adds &ldquo;one of the hardest phrases in the
Bible&rdquo;), &ldquo;the wheel of birth&rdquo; like the Orphic mysteries
(P. Gardner), &ldquo;sets the whole creation in flames&rdquo; (Johnstone).
Perhaps the idea is that the tongue at the center
(hub) of the wheel of nature sets on fire the rest of the wheel.
One sees just this thing happen in a pyrotechnic display,
where a wheel is set on fire in the center. The more it burns
the faster it revolves, till the whole wheel whirls in a blaze
of fire, spitting fire as it whirls. Certainly, the tongue can set
fire to all the baser passions in the wheel of life, such as envy,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
jealousy, faction, anger, avarice, lust, murder. This fire
spreads, not simply through the whole man, but may infect
&ldquo;various channels and classes till the whole cycle of human
life is in flames&rdquo; (Plummer). Its range of devastation frequently
is wider than the life of the person who spoke.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that James adds, &ldquo;and is set on fire by
hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;with a flame fed by hell&rdquo; (Moffatt), <i>inflammata a
gehenna</i> (Vulgate). It is the devil, the slanderer par excellence,
who sets on fire &ldquo;the chariot-wheel of man as he advances
on the way of life&rdquo; (Hort). It is first inflamed by hell
(place of the wicked, not the unseen world for all) and then
inflames all the wheel of nature. The torch is lighted in hell,
and the hellish flame kindles the tongue, which in turn sets
fire to the whole nature. Thus the fire was started and is
habitually replenished (the tense is imperfect). The Valley
of Hinnom or Tophet was first just the type of the abode of
the wicked, and then the continual fires kept burning there
were transferred to the next world. (Cf. &ldquo;the fire of Gehenna,&rdquo;
<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:22.</span>)</p>
<p>But one must not forget that while the tongue can be set
on fire of hell, it can also be touched by a live coal from God&rsquo;s
altar. Isaiah said, &ldquo;Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am
a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people
of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of
hosts. Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live
coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off
the altar: and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo,
this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away,
and thy sin forgiven&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">6:5-7</span>).</p>
<p>Let us gain comfort from the experience of Isaiah in the
contemplation of the solemn warning of James. One may
note also that tongues as of fire sat on the heads of those
who were filled with the Holy Spirit on the great day of
Pentecost. The tongue can be set on fire of heaven and can
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
pass on the holy fire of God from soul to soul, thus lighting
the light of God in the human life.</p>
<h3>Taming of Wild Beasts (<span class="scripRef">3:7 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>James recurs to the beasts (cf. horse and bridle) for a
broader discussion. The tongue is unbridled all too often and
is the most unmanageable of wild animals. He had just said
that the tongue is set on fire of hell. &ldquo;The fact that the tongue
is the one thing that defies man&rsquo;s power to control it is a sign
that there is something satanic in its bitterness&rdquo; (Mayor).
He uses the language of Oriental exaggeration in giving
further proof of his strong statement, a justifiable hyperbole:
&ldquo;For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and
things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The art of taming is no new thing, but has belonged
to the human race from the first&rdquo; (Mayor).</p>
<p>It is perhaps not strictly true that every conceivable animal
has been subjected by man, but no one in the light of the
past and the present can say that any animal is untamable.
It is now a common enough thing to see in a wild animal
show performing tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, monkeys,
dogs, horses, parrots, seals, bears, and even serpents. It is not
merely that wild animals may be domesticated (cf. the wolf
and the dog), like the zebra and the wild turkey (America&rsquo;s
contribution to the world&rsquo;s barnyard), but they may be
taught to do acts and tricks that show rudimentary reasoning
powers. The eye of man can subdue the lion, the tiger, and
the serpent as Jesus subdued the untamable demoniac (<span class="scripRef">Mark 5:4</span>),
&ldquo;and no man had strength to tame him.&rdquo; Man has
proved his kingship over the other creatures as God gave
him dominion (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 1:26</span>). In many cases animals have become
so domesticated that they no longer feel at home elsewhere.</p>
<p>Man is proud of his lordship over beast and bird and over
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
the forces of nature like wind and wave and electricity. Man
can swim like a fish, can run like a deer, and can now even
fly like a bird in the airplane with its artificial wings. He can
talk without wires with unseen persons over thousands of
miles. He can speed over land and sea like the wind. He can
send a message around the earth with the swiftness of light.</p>
<p>But he cannot control his own tongue. &ldquo;But the tongue can
no man tame.&rdquo; Here is the language of helplessness, as in the
case of the demoniac in <span class="scripRef">Mark 5:4</span>. Strictly speaking, of course,
the tongue is merely the organ of speech, and speech is under
the control of the mind. By a bold figure James almost personifies
the tongue as a separate personality. &ldquo;It combines
the ferocity of the tiger and the mockery of the ape with the
subtlety and venom of the serpent&rdquo; (Plummer). It is thus the
very chimera of wild beasts!</p>
<p>This is the picture of the tongue in its natural state, the
tongue of the unregenerate man. The Spirit of God can
cleanse a man&rsquo;s mouth of profanity and unclean speech.
&ldquo;Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Psalm 34:13</span>). Paul puts up the bars: &ldquo;Nor filthiness, nor
foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 5:4</span>).
Once more he says: &ldquo;Let no corrupt speech proceed
out of your mouth&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">4:29</span>). Surely, if one has such an untamable
little animal in his mouth as the tongue, he needs to
watch it with ceaseless care. The evil of the tongue echoes
and re-echoes through a community and often through the
ages. The evil slander can never be stopped. The lie is fleet of
foot and eludes truth in a race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a restless evil,&rdquo; &ldquo;plague of disorder that it is&rdquo; (Moffatt),
&ldquo;a disorderly evil&rdquo; (Hort), <i>iniquitum malum</i> (Vulgate).
It is unstable and unreliable, inconsistent and quixotic.
It can never be trusted to the full. It will turn on one when
off guard, like the lion when the keeper turns his eye away.
It can be brought under no rules that will work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is full of deadly poison.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;death-bringing&rdquo; poison
like the poison of asps under their lips (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 140:3</span>).
&ldquo;Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the
deaf adder that stoppeth her ear&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 58:4</span>). The poison
of the serpent is deposited in a little pocket under the mouth.
So the tongue is charged with the venom of hate, as the
serpent with poison. The hiss of the serpent and the hiss of
the goose are often reproduced in the sibilant tongue of
slander.</p>
<h3>Sweet and Bitter Water (<span class="scripRef">3:9-11</span>)</h3>
<p>The inconsistency of the conduct of the tongue is graphically
portrayed by these verses. Plummer happily terms it
&ldquo;the moral contradictions of the reckless talker.&rdquo; There is in
very truth moral chaos if the Christian does not control his
tongue. Inconsistency is not an evil per se. If one is wrong, he
ought to be inconsistent enough to change and do right. But
it is terrible to see a professing Christian lightly lapse into
loose and licentious language. &ldquo;The fires of Pentecost will
not rest where the fires of Gehenna are working&rdquo; (Plummer).</p>
<p>James had spoken (<span class="scripRef">1:8</span>) of the double-minded man, unstable
in all his ways. The tongue with the gift of <i>double-entendre</i>
is one of the very worst, for its word passes muster
in polite circles and yet carries to the initiated a sinister or
salacious meaning. Epictetus (Ench. xxxiii, &sect; 16) says, &ldquo;But
dangerous also is the approach to indecent speaking.&rdquo; But
the double tongue talks one way with one person, another
with another; it is the way of hypocrisy, the slick tongue, the
oily tongue of the two-faced man whose word cannot be depended
upon, whose word is not so good as his bond.</p>
<p>Sirach (<span class="scripRef">5:13</span>) says: &ldquo;Honor and shame are in talk; and the
tongue of man is his fall.&rdquo; He also has this: &ldquo;If thou blow the
spark, it shall burn; if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched;
and both these come out of thy mouth&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">28:12</span>). It looks as if
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
James had seen this passage from the Twelve Patriarchs
(<span class="scripRef">Benjamin 6:5</span>): &ldquo;The good mind hath not two tongues, of
blessing and of cursing, of contumely and of honour, of sorrow
and of joy, of quietness and of confusion, of hypocrisy
and of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may omit the inconsistency of &ldquo;sorrow and of joy,&rdquo;
for that is the lot of all of us, but certainly the tongue must
not play the part of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. &ldquo;Therewith
bless we the Lord and Father,&rdquo; the only instance of this
precise combination of words in the Bible, expressing God&rsquo;s
power and loving approachableness (cf. <span class="scripRef">Matt. 11:25</span>). The
highest function of human speech (Hort) is the praise of
God the Father. Note how when Zacharias recovered his
speech, he first praised God (<span class="scripRef">Luke 1:64</span>). It is glorious to
praise God in prayer, in song, in sermon. &ldquo;O Lord, open thou
my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 51:15</span>).
&ldquo;Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul. While
I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God
while I have any being&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 146:1 f.</span>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless, and curse not&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 12:14</span>). Curse not God in
anger or in flippant profanity. The tongue that praises God
surely will not profane his name. But curse not men who are
made after the likeness of God, those who are like God in
their moral and spiritual nature and not like the beasts of
the field (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 1:26</span>; <span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 3:18</span>). And yet, <i>horribile dictu</i>,
this is precisely what we do. &ldquo;Therewith curse we men.&rdquo;
James here includes himself in the common run of humanity.</p>
<p>The tongue exercises this strange power of running away
with us like a runaway horse with the bit in his mouth. The
scorn of men for men is seen in <span class="scripRef">John 7:49</span>, in the Pharisees&rsquo;
sneer at the mob: &ldquo;This multitude that knoweth not the
law are accursed.&rdquo; It is most likely, however, personal abuse
that James here refers to. Men who are made in God&rsquo;s image
are abused by the very tongue that blesses God. We curse
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
other children of our common Father, God. James does not
mean, even by implication, to approve cursing at all. It is
the wicked man whose &ldquo;mouth is full of cursing&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 10:7</span>).
If we do not love our brother, we do not love God
(<span class="scripRef">1 John 4:20</span>). And yet &ldquo;out of the same mouth cometh forth
blessing and cursing.&rdquo; We make our tongue a sort of combination
of Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. &ldquo;My brethren,
these things ought not so to be&rdquo;&mdash;a mild statement all the
more effective from its very temperateness.</p>
<p>The point is easy to illustrate. &ldquo;Doth the fountain send
forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?&rdquo; James
was familiar with the brackish waters of parts of Palestine.
The water of the Dead Sea is really bitter, though fed by the
snows of Hermon and the sweet springs of the Jordan valley.
The waters of Marah were bitter (<span class="scripRef">Ex. 15:23</span>), and one may
recall &ldquo;the water of bitterness that causeth the curse&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Num. 5:18, 23</span>).
See also <span class="scripRef">Revelation 8:11</span> for the waters that were
made bitter. Pliny (N. H. ii. 103) tells a fable of a fountain of
the sun that &ldquo;was sweet and cold at noon and bitter and hot
at midnight&rdquo; (Mayor). It is possible to sweeten water, as
we see in the great filtering plants in our modern cities.
And sweet water can become bitter. But water is not sweet
and bitter at the same time from the same fountain. You have
sweet water on Hermon and salt water in the Dead Sea (also
called the Salt Sea), but not both in the same place.</p>
<h3>The Vine and the Fig Tree (<span class="scripRef">3:12</span>)</h3>
<p>James has not only a new image here but also a new point
of view (Hort). He has, in <span class="scripRef">verses 9-11</span>, shown the inconsistency
of two kinds of speech from the same tongue. Now
he goes deeper to the heart behind the utterance. The comparison
is here made between the heart and its utterance
(tongue). The grape and the fig are the commonest fruits in
Palestine. &ldquo;Each tree is known by its own fruit&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 6:44</span>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Yes, and Jesus had just said (<span class="scripRef">6:43</span>): &ldquo;For there is no
good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt
tree that bringeth forth good fruit.&rdquo; It is not uncommon
to find the point made somewhat as James has it. So Epictetus (Diss. ii. 20)
says: &ldquo;How can a vine grow, not vinewise, but
olivewise, or an olive, on the other hand, not olivewise, but
vinewise?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> And Jesus says: &ldquo;Either make the tree good, and
its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:33</span>). Once more hear Jesus: &ldquo;Do men gather grapes
of thorns, or figs of thistles?&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 7:16</span>). It is the appeal to
life.</p>
<p>It has been charged that James exaggerates the evil of the
tongue, but one who knows life as it is must agree with James.
Sirach says, &ldquo;Curse the whisperer and the double-tongued,
for such have destroyed many that were at peace&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">28:13</span>).
Plummer quotes also a clause from the Syriac that is not in
the Greek: &ldquo;Also the third tongue, let it be cursed; for it has
laid low many corpses.&rdquo; Sirach (<span class="scripRef">28:14 f.</span>) continues: &ldquo;A third
[or backbiting] tongue hath unsettled many, and driven
them from nation to nation; and strong cities hath pulled
down, and overthrown houses of great men. A backbiting
tongue hath cast out capable women, and deprived them of
their labors.&rdquo; The &ldquo;third tongue&rdquo; injures three classes (Plummer):
the person who utters the slander, the one who listens,
and the one of whom the slander is told. It is a triple sin
and only sin. &ldquo;Neither can salt water yield sweet,&rdquo; James
adds, and his conclusion falls with the force of a trip hammer.
The crisp wisdom of James about the tongue makes one
wonder afresh if his mother had not taught him some of these
aphorisms as a child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c9">IX
<br />The True Wise Man</h2>
<p>The connection between the paragraph about wisdom
(<span class="scripRef">3:13-18</span>) and the preceding discussion of the perils of the
tongue is very close. James is still thinking of the men who
supposed that they had true faith but who did not practice
it; &ldquo;men who supposed that they had a deeper wisdom and
a larger knowledge than their brethren, and who were continually
asserting their claim to be teachers&rdquo; (Dale). But
Hort considers the passage on the tongue a &ldquo;long digression,&rdquo;
a view hardly tenable. These ambitious teachers had overlooked
the havoc wrought by tongue (and pen).</p>
<p>James has given a needed warning about that phase of the
subject and now turns to the subject matter itself. The ambitious
teacher will do all the more harm if he is not merely
a bungler of real wisdom but a disseminator of false wisdom.
Already the air was full of all sorts of fads and fancies that
appealed to the unthinking and the unwary. The Essenes,
the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Epicureans, the Stoics,
the Mithraists, the Gnostics, the Judaizers, the cult of emperor
worship, with more or less distinctness were clamoring
for a hearing. There were professional sophists who traveled
over the country with patent solutions of all problems. Some
appealed to the nervous or the neurotic, like Christian Science
today; others to the ignorant, like Russellism or Mormonism.
Paul will later discuss both speech and wisdom &ldquo;as
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
good things liable to grievous abuse&rdquo; (Hort), in
<span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 1:5, 17; 2; and 3</span>.</p>
<h3>The Call for the Wise Man (<span class="scripRef">3:13a</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Who is wise and understanding among you?&rdquo; The question
does not mean that nobody is wise and understanding,
but it calls a halt on the rush of volunteers who have apparently
a superfluity of wisdom. An overplus of conceit is
intolerable for normal persons. Job (<span class="scripRef">12:2</span>) has our sympathy
when he retorts to his officious advisers: &ldquo;No doubt but ye
are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.&rdquo; Once more
Job (<span class="scripRef">28:12</span>) asks: &ldquo;But where shall wisdom be found? and
where is the place of understanding?&rdquo; Here, as very often in
the Old Testament, we have wisdom and understanding
used together. God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding
(<span class="scripRef">1 Kings 4:29</span>). &ldquo;Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore
get wisdom; ... get understanding&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Prov. 4:7</span>). In
<span class="scripRef">Psalm 107:43</span> we have the question: &ldquo;Who is wise?&rdquo; James
is thoroughly acquainted with the wisdom literature of the
Jews, both canonical and uncanonical, and is at home in
the handling of this theme. His words are not many, but
they carry much of depth and power.</p>
<p>Many of the professional wise men, then as now, were
frauds who easily duped the gullible populace. They were
magicians like Simon Magus, who gave it out that he was
some great man, and the idle crowd took him at his high
estimate of himself (<span class="scripRef">Acts 8:9 ff.</span>). Note also the cases of Bar-Jesus
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 13:6 ff.</span>) and the Jewish exorcists (<span class="scripRef">19:13 ff.</span>).
The success of these men is one of the most humiliating contemplations
about our common humanity. Carlyle bluntly
called most people fools. But there were really wise men then
also, like the Magi and others, who sought light and truth.
Oesterley thinks that James by this question appeals to the
self-respect of his hearers, who are tired of men with &ldquo;the lust
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
of teaching and talking&rdquo; (Plummer). James is still directing
blows at sham religion, and there is ample cause for such
attacks in all the ages. Hypocrisy flourishes in all ages and
in all climes. This meanest of parasites has a marvelous vitality.</p>
<p>The combination of &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; is not
without point (cf. <span class="scripRef">Deut. 4:6</span>; <span class="scripRef">Isa. 5:21</span>). This is the only instance
of the combination in the New Testament. In classic
Greek the second word was used of a skilled or scientific
person who had gained technical knowledge of a subject. It
implies personal acquaintance and experience, not mere abstract
knowledge or intellectual apprehension of the theory
of a thing. It is book learning plus practical application, as
opposed to one without this special training. Then the word
for wise is given by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. I. v.) to
mean &ldquo;the understanding of things human and divine, and
their causes.&rdquo; It is the word found in the term &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;
and implies thoughtfulness, penetration, grasp of the relations
of things, and the right use of one&rsquo;s knowledge for the
highest ends. There are learned fools, men who have a lumber
of learning in their heads but in a disorderly jumble. In
the use of James the only really wise man is he who places
God in the center of his life, who serves Christ as Lord and
Master, who keeps the intellect in subjection to the will of
God.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ignorant fools also, men who have
neither intellectual apprehension nor practical wisdom. It is
hard to tell which is the sadder spectacle, the learned fool or
the ignorant fool. But, certainly, a premium is not to be
placed upon either class. Both classes of fools are to be kept
out of the ranks of teachers and preachers if it can be done.
Advice on all sorts of subjects is so plentiful that there seems
to be an abundance of easygoing wisdom. But the world is
still eager to listen to the true wise man if he can be found
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
(cf. Van Dyke&rsquo;s <i>Other Wise Man</i>). But the very reputation
for wisdom may lead to posing as a wise man. James dares to
challenge the candidates for teachers of wisdom in the
churches. Is it not possible that not enough care is taken in
the choice of teachers in the churches and the ordination of
preachers of the gospel?</p>
<h3>The Proof of the Wise Man (<span class="scripRef">3:13b</span>)</h3>
<p>Wisdom is not a matter for mere technical inquiry. One
has to stand an examination on wisdom; but it is that of life,
unwritten and written&mdash;that of deeds, not of words. &ldquo;Let
him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.&rdquo;
This test of the wise man is put in a peculiarly Jacobean
style. The very position of the word &ldquo;show&rdquo; is emphatic; it is
the first word in the sentence. If one may use the vernacular,
we are all &ldquo;from Missouri&rdquo; and &ldquo;have to be shown&rdquo; when it
comes to each other&rsquo;s wisdom. The test is the acid test of
deeds, not words. We may quibble over words and talk like
a wise man, but time will prove our words by our deeds.</p>
<p>One may speak like a wise man and in reality be the biggest
sort of a fool, yea, a scoundrel. People have learned to
discount mere talk when it stands alone. Just being a
preacher is not enough. One must practice what he preaches.
The Roman Catholic doctrine relieves the priest from the obligation
to live the morality which he preaches, but surely
that is a travesty on the ethics of Christianity. It is false
ethics and false religion. People have a right to hold the
preacher to the standard of the gospel, just as he has the
right to urge upon them the highest ideals of conduct. There
is a wonderful leveling process going on all the time. Lincoln
said with rare wisdom that a man may fool all the people
part of the time and some of the people all the time, but not
all the people all the time.</p>
<p>The greatest asset that the preacher has, after all, is his
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
life, a long life of piety and consecration. There is no answering
that argument&mdash;&ldquo;by his good life his works.&rdquo; This is
the only proof that counts in the long run. The King James
Version has here &ldquo;good conversation,&rdquo; which was at one time
good English (<i>conversatio</i>, <i>conversari</i>), originally one&rsquo;s conduct
or bearing (turning oneself about, the precise idea in
the Greek word). But long ago the English confined the
word to talk, perhaps because some people did little else but
talk. But quaint English must give way to the modern preciseness
of speech.</p>
<p>It is the beautiful manner of life that speaks the language
of business today, the flower of a white life that adorns the
profession of the service of Christ. But even so, it must be
behavior that is sincere, that finds expression in acts, not
mere external mannerisms, posing, attitudinizing, stage effect.
Nothing is more repulsive than professional pietists who
attract attention to themselves rather than to Christ the
Lord. It is a case pre-eminently where actions speak louder
than words and where words alone do more harm than good.
Bengel puts it tersely: <i>re potius quam verbis</i>. In simple truth,
the more a man says in claim of superior wisdom, the less he
is credited with the possession of any wisdom.</p>
<p>But it is not merely a case of deeds versus words but also
of &ldquo;gentleness and modesty versus arrogance and passion&rdquo;
(Mayor), &ldquo;in meekness of wisdom,&rdquo; &ldquo;with the modesty of
wisdom&rdquo; (Moffatt). Meekness was not ranked high among
the Greeks. Aristotle (Eth. Nic. IV. v) considered it a second-rate
virtue, &ldquo;the mean between passionateness and impassionateness&rdquo;
(Plummer). Epictetus (bk. II, chap, i, &sect; 36)
says: &ldquo;But think that thou art nobody and that thou knowest
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christian conception rests upon the idea in the Psalms
that meekness is a favorite trait of the devout. &ldquo;The meek
will he guide in justice; and the meek will he teach his way&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
(<span class="scripRef">25:9</span>). &ldquo;Jehovah upholdeth the meek&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">147:6</span>). In Sirach
(<span class="scripRef">3:18</span>) we read: &ldquo;The greater you are, the more you humble
yourself.&rdquo; But there is no word comparable to that of
Jesus, who said of himself, &ldquo;I am meek and lowly in heart&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 11:29</span>), in his plea for men to come to him as teacher.
It is an essential prerequisite in the teacher, else he is unapproachable
and is aloof and cold. Jesus pronounced a Beatitude
on the meek (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:5</span>), but he did more&mdash;he exemplified
meekness in his life.</p>
<p>By meekness James does not mean effeminacy or weakness
(any more than did Jesus). He does mean the absence of
pretentiousness and wilfulness. Peter (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 3:15</span>) uses the
expression &ldquo;with meekness and fear&rdquo; for the spirit with which
one is to defend the faith, the &ldquo;reason concerning the hope
that is in you.&rdquo; There can be firmness and courage without
bumptiousness and bigotry. There are frequent exhortations
in the New Testament along this line (cf. <span class="scripRef">Gal. 6:1</span>; <span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 2:24</span>;
<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 4:21</span>). The wise man wears the crown of modesty.
This spiritual paradox seems absurd to the merely
worldly-wise.</p>
<h3>The Disproof of the Wise Man (<span class="scripRef">3:14</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The possession of wisdom was made a claim to teachership&rdquo;
(Hort). So the absence of wisdom is a positive disqualification.
One may, no doubt, possess wisdom and yet
not be able to teach. But the lack of wisdom is itself a sufficient
bar. The wrong spirit shows the lack of wisdom. &ldquo;But
if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart,&rdquo; what
then? There were many controversialists who had both of
these vices.</p>
<p>Jealousy is not evil per se. It wavers between the good and
evil sense and in itself is merely zeal, which may be for good
or ill. (For the good use see <span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 11:2</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 1:14</span>.) Sometimes
this zeal was not according to knowledge (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 10:2</span>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
Envy is distinguished from zeal (emulation) by Aristotle
(Rhet. ii. 11. 1). But in the New Testament the bad sense of
this word prevails (<span class="scripRef">James 4:5</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 3:3</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 5:20</span>; <span class="scripRef">Rom. 13:13</span>),
and it is listed with the works of the flesh. The bitterness
of jealousy is only too well understood by those who
give way to this petty vice. It tastes bitter, and the taste lasts
a long time. Bitterness is itself punishment enough for the
victims of the sin (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 4:31</span>).</p>
<p>The other word, &ldquo;faction&rdquo; or &ldquo;party spirit,&rdquo; has an uncertain
etymology, probably from the word for hireling. At any
rate, the word is soon applied to partisans who court and
bribe adherents to their candidate. It presents the very
quintessence of partisanship and of narrow-mindedness. This
is not a mark of wisdom and is not a thing to boast of, at any
rate. &ldquo;Glory not&rdquo; about it, &ldquo;do not pride yourselves on that&rdquo;
(Moffatt). And yet this is precisely what many of the Jewish
Christians were doing already. Thus they lied against the
truth, were &ldquo;false to the truth,&rdquo; as Moffatt has it. Such partisan
triumph is usually obtained by underhand methods and
by the suppression of part of the truth. There is such a thing
as &ldquo;poisoned truth.&rdquo; So partisan victory often leaves a bitter
sting, because those in defeat know that an unfair advantage
has been taken of them and of the truth of God.</p>
<p>It is clear that these opening chapters in the Epistle of
James reveal a pitiful condition of controversy among some
of the Jewish churches, such as Paul has to rebuke in Corinth
later (cf. <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 1-4</span>). &ldquo;The whole Christianity of many a
devotee consists only, we may say, in a bitter contempt for
the sins of sinners, in a proud and loveless contention with
what it calls the wicked world&rdquo; (Stier).</p>
<p>The point of James is precisely this. The very contentiousness
which they regarded as supreme proof of their qualifications
as exponents of the faith is here urged by James as absolute
proof that they are disqualified for the position of
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
teachers. Their bitterness makes it improper for them to talk
about love and gentleness. Sometimes the very fierceness of
one&rsquo;s contention for orthodoxy drives some people into
heresy. It is a sad outcome when one&rsquo;s high and holy ambition
to teach the things of Christ is frustrated by a Christless
spirit of wrangling and personal abuse.</p>
<h3>The Wisdom from Below (<span class="scripRef">3:15 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>Wisdom is precisely what we all need and desire, but the
bitter self-seeking partisans just described &ldquo;do not cherish
the truth except as a possession of their own, or a missile of
their own&rdquo; (Hort). &ldquo;This wisdom,&rdquo; claimed by the pompous
bigots in <span class="scripRef">verse 14</span>, can only be so described in terms of courtesy
or, more exactly, of irony. It is only wisdom so-called
and is real folly. It is at best worldly wisdom, &ldquo;earthly,&rdquo; not
merely in the sense of taking place on earth rather than in
heaven (<span class="scripRef">John 3:12</span>) but with the earthly horizon and outlook
as opposed to the heavenly, like those who mind earthly
things (<span class="scripRef">Phil. 3:19</span>). Such a wisdom passes for &ldquo;the wisdom of
this world&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 1:20</span>; <span class="scripRef">3:19</span>) but is distinctly not &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
wisdom,&rdquo; &ldquo;a wisdom not of this world&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 2:6 f.</span>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wisdom&rdquo; is not merely earthly but does not come
down from above, more exactly, &ldquo;is not of a kind that cometh
down&rdquo; (Hort)&mdash;not such a wisdom, indeed, as God gives
(<span class="scripRef">James 1:5</span>). It has the smell of earth in the evil sense of that
term. It is not from above but in reality from below. Jesus said
to the Pharisees: &ldquo;Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye
are of this world; I am not of this world&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">John 8:23</span>). The
antithesis is complete both in origin and spirit. The axioms
of the selfish, like &ldquo;look out for Number One,&rdquo; are the wisdom
of the devil: &ldquo;All that a man hath will he give for his
life&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Job 2:4</span>).</p>
<p>This selfish wisdom is merely that of the natural man, not
a mark of the regenerate spirit. There is no single English
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
word that properly renders this word. &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; transliterates
it but does not translate it. &ldquo;Sensual&rdquo; makes it too much a
matter of the body, as does &ldquo;fleshly,&rdquo; like the Vulgate <i>animalis</i>.
It does not appear in the Septuagint and only six times
in the New Testament (<span class="scripRef">James 3:15</span>; <span class="scripRef">Jude 19</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 2:14; 15:44, 46</span>).
The broad distinction between soul and body or
mind and body (dichotomy) is not so hard to grasp, but the
threefold division (trichotomy) into spirit, soul, and body,
as in <span class="scripRef">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>, seems to place the psyche below
the pneuma.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a></p>
<p>It seems clear from <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 2:14</span> that the spiritual
man is the regenerate man, while the natural man is the unregenerate
man in his unsaved state of sin. So here, therefore,
this earthly wisdom is that of the unregenerate man; it is not
sanctified wisdom. He may not be carnal, the slave of the
animal passions, but merely coldly unspiritual. Such a wisdom
does not reach the higher levels of the man&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>But it is still worse. Such a wisdom is demoniacal, devilish
(<i>diabolica</i>, Vulgate), &ldquo;in that it raised up the very devil in
the hearts of both opposer and opposed&rdquo; (Oesterley). It is
wisdom such as that which demons have (Bengel), not such
as God gives (<span class="scripRef">1:5</span>). It is the wisdom of those who do the will
of the flesh (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 2:2 f.</span>), who follow the teaching of demons
(<span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 4:1</span>). One is reminded of the words of Jesus in <span class="scripRef">John 8:44</span>:
&ldquo;Ye are of your father the devil.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus the wisdom
shared by demons answers to the faith shared by demons of
<span class="scripRef">2:19</span>&rdquo; (Hort), the tongue set on fire by hell (<span class="scripRef">3:6</span>).</p>
<p>It is indeed a keen knowledge of human nature that James
here reveals, but it is a sad indictment all the same. It reads
like nature in the rough, red in tooth and claw, the law of
the jungle, not the law of grace. It is Nietzsche&rsquo;s superman,
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
not the love that serves, that came to minister and not to be
ministered unto. The might of right is not understood by
those who hold that might is right. There is a new paganism
today in Berlin, in Paris, in London, in New York. It is very
subtle and very scornful of the pity of Jesus.</p>
<p>Red blood is a good thing, to be sure, so be it that it courses
through a clean heart. The survival of the fittest is the law of
nature, but fittest for what? The law of the wolves is to turn
and devour the wolf that falls in the chase. The philosophy
of Nietzsche is a bit more brutal in its plainness of speech
than the wisdom of the world usually puts it. But even so, its
demoniacal character stands out more sharply. &ldquo;I want;
therefore, I have the right to get.&rdquo; This is the policy of aggression
on the part of nations and individuals, of rogues
and rapists, of grafters and white-slavers, of bank-looters
and oppressors of labor.</p>
<p>The further comment of James elucidates his point: &ldquo;For
where jealousy and faction are (<span class="scripRef">v. 14</span>), there is confusion
and every vile deed.&rdquo; Jealousy and faction come from the
devil. He sows suspicion in the churches, in the midst of
families, in the hearts of those who let him in. James had already
(<span class="scripRef">3:8</span>) accused the tongue of being a restless evil and
(<span class="scripRef">1:8</span>) had spoken of the unstable man. God is not the God of
confusion but of peace (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 14:33</span>), so that the factions in
the churches cannot claim God as supporting them, any more
than nations at war have the right to make flippant claims
that God is on their side in a conflict.</p>
<p>Oesterley has a fine description of the spirit of the professional
controversialist: &ldquo;Acute argument, subtle distinctions,
clever controversial methods which took small account of
truth so long as a temporary point was gained, skilful dialectics,
bitter sarcasms, the more enjoyed and triumphed in
if the poisonous shaft came home and rankled in the breast of
the opponent&mdash;in short, all those tricks of the unscrupulous
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
controversialist, which are none the less contemptible for
being clever&mdash;this was wisdom of a certain kind.&rdquo; But in
reality it left the way open for &ldquo;every vile deed,&rdquo; for the
word here for &ldquo;vile&rdquo; means worthless, not immoral.</p>
<p>In the realm of morals what is merely indifferent soon
gets to be bad. The Vulgate puts it <i>omne opus pravum</i>. So in
<span class="scripRef">John 3:20</span> we read: &ldquo;For every one that doeth evil hateth
the light.&rdquo; Bugs and bats hate the light. There is a toboggan
slide in sin. The easy way is the evil way. See per contra
<span class="scripRef">James 1:17</span>. Anarchy brings moral chaos (Plummer) to the
soul as to nations. The wiseacres of the world play havoc
with the souls and bodies of men who follow their lead to
hell. In every town there is a bunch of men who cling together
in their evil life and profess a wisdom superior to that
of the gospel. They know it is a lie, but they comfort each
other and are too proud to break away from the gang. But
the end will come. There are no happy old men save those
that are Christians.</p>
<h3>The Wisdom from Above (<span class="scripRef">3:17</span>)</h3>
<p>There is wisdom from above, that is, from God, as James
had already said (<span class="scripRef">1:5</span>). This is the true wisdom, God&rsquo;s wisdom
both in source and character. James had not, of course,
seen Paul&rsquo;s remarks on wisdom in <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 1 and 2</span>, if he
wrote his epistle by <span class="small">A.D.</span> 50. But he had full opportunity to be
familiar with Proverbs, the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of
Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon. &ldquo;For the Lord giveth
wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Prov. 2:6</span>, AV). &ldquo;Wisdom may praise herself, and
glory in the midst of her people&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Sir. 24:1</span>). &ldquo;For wisdom is
more mobile than any motion; and she also passeth and goeth
through all things by reason of her pureness. For she is a
breath of the power of God, and a pure effluence from the
glory of the Almighty; therefore no defiled thing falls into
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
her. For she is a reflection of the everlasting light, and an
unspotted mirror of the efficiency of God, and image of his
goodness&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Wisd. 7:24-26</span>).</p>
<p>Once more: &ldquo;For she is more beautiful than the sun, and
above every position of stars, being compared with the light,
she is found superior&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Wisd. 7:29</span>). But while James is undoubtedly
conversant with the wisdom literature of the Jews,
he is no mere copyist. He has the Christian standpoint and
makes his own contribution to the discussion of wisdom. His
words are few, but they fit and strike right to the heart of the
subject.</p>
<p>It is &ldquo;first pure.&rdquo; Purity is the inner characteristic of the
wise. It is pretty nearly like the Latin <i>purus</i> (pure) and
means not so much cleansed (cf. <span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:8</span>, &ldquo;the pure in
heart&rdquo;) as a combination of this idea and consecration as
holiness. It is thus free from stain or defilement of any kind
(not merely sexual purity), like a ray of light, &ldquo;in holiness
and sincerity of God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 1:12</span>). Christ himself is called
pure (<span class="scripRef">1 John 3:3</span>), the ideal toward which we are to strive.
We must learn to put first things first. In wisdom purity of
character and motive is absolutely essential at any cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then peaceable.&rdquo; Important as peace is, purity is paramount.
Peaceableness is, to be sure, the outer characteristic
of wisdom, and if one has the bright light of inner wisdom,
he will have it. But wisdom does not desire peace at any
price or at the cost of purity. &ldquo;All her paths are peace&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Prov. 3:17</span>),
and the chastening of God&rsquo;s hand yields &ldquo;peaceable
fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 12:11</span>).
Plummer wisely notes that the order of James here
is logical and not always strictly chronological.</p>
<p>One is not to compromise with evil and error, but all the
same, if one is to have no peace till he has absolute purity
of every sort in his environment, he must needs be always at
war and never rest at all. An equation of common sense must,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
of course, be struck, though there is the constant temptation
to get used to unpleasant surroundings and finally to make
no protest at all. Plummer likewise observes that James places
the emphasis on the spiritual and moral, not on the intellectual,
just the opposite of modern ideals of culture and education.
There is nothing in the position of James to justify the
Spanish Inquisition, for instance. The persecutor has often
consoled himself with the thought that he is doing his victim&rsquo;s
soul a real service by rescuing him from his error.</p>
<p>Certainly, if one is pure, it is easier for him to be peaceable,
provided he also loves. &ldquo;If it be possible, as much as in you
lieth, be at peace with all men&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 12:18</span>). There is a
great deal in the New Testament on the subject of peace. It
is true that Jesus said, &ldquo;I came not to bring peace, but a
sword&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 10:34</span>), when men are wedded to sin and
can only be shaken loose by the sword of truth. But there are
those who let the peace of God rule in their hearts as umpire
(<span class="scripRef">Col. 3:15</span>). We are to pursue the things of peace (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 14:19</span>)
as men of peace but not to be afraid to stand up for
truth and righteousness (purity), even if we have to fight.</p>
<p>Then &ldquo;gentle,&rdquo; &ldquo;forbearing&rdquo; (Hort). The word is used by
Thucydides (viii. 93) of men who will listen to reason, and
(i. 76) of moderation, like the Latin <i>clementia</i>. Originally
the word meant what was fitting, fair, reasonable, but it was
also associated with the idea of yielding, &ldquo;implying one who
does not stand on his rights, but is ready to give way to the
wishes of others&rdquo; (Mayor). Matthew Arnold gathered the
idea into his phrase &ldquo;sweet reasonableness.&rdquo; Aristotle (vi.
11) uses it of the forgiving man, one who does not stand on
strict justice but who listens to merciful consideration. Certainly
gentleness is the true mark of the gentleman who
does not stickle over little points, who, in a word, is considerate.</p>
<p>The Christian wisdom, therefore, does not like to give
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
pain. Paul makes an appeal &ldquo;by the meekness and gentleness
of Christ&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 10:1</span>). See also <span class="scripRef">Acts 24:4</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Timothy 3:3</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Titus 3:2</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:18</span> (gentle masters); and in particular,
<span class="scripRef">Philippians 4:5</span>: &ldquo;Let your forbearance be known
unto all men.&rdquo; It means the very essence of fairness as opposed
to unreasonableness (<span class="scripRef">Ps. Sol. 5:14</span>). Compare Paul&rsquo;s
panegyric on love (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 13</span>).</p>
<p>It is also &ldquo;easy to be entreated,&rdquo; &ldquo;conciliatory&rdquo; (Moffatt).
The word is a common one for military discipline (<span class="scripRef">4 Macc. 8:6</span>;
Jos. War ii. 20,7), though it does not occur elsewhere in
the New Testament. As &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; refers usually to one in a
superior position, so this word is used mainly of one in an inferior
rank (Mayor). The good soldier is the one who has
learned how to execute orders. Philo employs it as the opposite
of the disobedient. It is <i>tractabilis</i>, not <i>morosa</i>. The
Vulgate has <i>suadibilis</i>. It is a word in common use about
children, pupils, all who obey laws. If preachers were always
gentle, perhaps the church members would be more docile
and teachable. This wisdom from above is <i>suaviter in modo,
fortiter in re</i>.</p>
<p>It is also &ldquo;full of mercy and good fruits.&rdquo; This is just the
reverse of the party feeling already condemned. Mercy is the
active principle of compassionate love. One may note already
<span class="scripRef">1:8, 27; 2:13</span> in contrast with <span class="scripRef">2:15</span>. This wisdom bears
good (&ldquo;wholesome,&rdquo; Moffatt) fruits, not mere leaves (empty
boasting). The plural (fruits) shows that there is variety and
abundance for all. It is not satisfied with abstract virtue but
wishes to bless others.</p>
<p>This wisdom is likewise &ldquo;without variance,&rdquo; &ldquo;unambiguous&rdquo;
(Moffatt). The word occurs nowhere else in the New
Testament and has puzzled translators a great deal. It is
rendered &ldquo;without wrangling,&rdquo; &ldquo;without judging,&rdquo; &ldquo;without
partiality,&rdquo; &ldquo;without distinctions,&rdquo; &ldquo;undoubted,&rdquo; &ldquo;without
feigning,&rdquo; &ldquo;without doubtfulness,&rdquo; &ldquo;undecided,&rdquo; &ldquo;unhesitating,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
&ldquo;unwavering,&rdquo; &ldquo;single-minded.&rdquo; The Vulgate has
<i>non judicans</i>.</p>
<p>Something can be said for all these renderings. The context
must decide.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> If one considers the use of the verb in
<span class="scripRef">James 1:6</span> and <span class="scripRef">2:4</span>, probably the idea of decision is the true
one here. It is wholehearted conviction, positiveness in adherence
to the truth, single-minded devotion rather than the
wavering indecision of false wisdom. It is Principal Forsyth&rsquo;s
idea of &ldquo;Positive Preaching&rdquo; for the modern mind.</p>
<p>It is finally &ldquo;without hypocrisy,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> &ldquo;straightforward&rdquo; (Moffatt).
Here there is no ambiguity as to the import of the
word. It is not the hypocritical wisdom of earth, the spurious
invitation, but the genuine article. It is sincere, &ldquo;without
show or pretence&rdquo; (Mayor). The word is used of love (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 12:9</span>;
<span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 6:6</span>), of faith (<span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 1:5</span>), of brotherly love
(<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:22</span>). The idea here concerns our relations with
men as the preceding adjective outlined our attitude toward
God (Hort). This wisdom has the ring of pure gold and
passes at par value with all men. Surely such wisdom as this
will always be in demand by modern men who love reality
and hate pretense.</p>
<h3>The Harvest of Righteousness (<span class="scripRef">3:18</span>)</h3>
<p>In this verse James gathers up the sum and substance of
all that he has had to say so far. He has just spoken of peace
and of good fruits. He has been insisting on righteous deeds
and not mere words, upon a live faith, not a dead creed.
&ldquo;And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that
make peace.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the peacemakers who sow in peace reap
righteousness&rdquo; (Moffatt). The fruit is righteousness (genitive
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
of apposition). The figure of sowing is common enough.
It is the slow process of soil, seed, plant, blossom, fruit, harvest.</p>
<p>This is the life of piety (wisdom) that James lays before
his readers. The phraseology occurs elsewhere (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 1:3</span>).
Thus <span class="scripRef">Proverbs 11:30</span>: &ldquo;The fruit of the righteous is a tree of
life.&rdquo; So in <span class="scripRef">Amos 6:12</span> we have &ldquo;fruit of righteousness.&rdquo; In
the New Testament note <span class="scripRef">Philippians 1:11</span>, &ldquo;filled with the
fruits of righteousness,&rdquo; and <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 12:11</span>, &ldquo;peaceable
fruit.&rdquo; There is a difficulty here in the fact that the fruit instead
of the seed is sown. But such a prolepsis of thought is
not unknown, as in <span class="scripRef">Psalm 97:11</span>: &ldquo;Light is sown for the righteous.&rdquo;
The sower sows in peace, and the harvest of righteousness
is gathered in peace. The peacemaker has the rainbow
promise of his harvest in due time if he does not faint nor
grow weary. &ldquo;They who make peace show likeness to God,
the great maker of peace&rdquo; (Hort).</p>

<h2 id="c10">X
<br />The Outer and the Inner Life</h2>
<p>Oesterley thinks it inconceivable that <span class="scripRef">4:1-12</span> could have
been addressed to Jewish churches at an early date, while
they were still in the fresh glow of the new faith in Christ.
He says, &ldquo;These verses reveal an appalling state of moral
depravity in these <i>Diaspora</i> congregations; strife, self-indulgence,
lust, murder, covetousness, adultery, envy, pride
and slander are rife; the conception of the nature of prayer
seems to have been altogether wrong among these people,
and they appear to be given over wholly to a life of pleasure.
It must have been terrible for the writer to contemplate such
a sink of iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, but James does not say that <i>all</i> the Christians were
guilty of these sins. It was bad enough without overstating
the situation. Besides, we have the state of affairs in the
church at Corinth to guide us as to the possibility of sins in a
young church, and the state of affairs among the Galatian
churches is not much better (cf. &ldquo;so soon departing&rdquo;). Covetousness
and strife early appear in the church in Jerusalem,
as we know from <span class="scripRef">Acts 4 and 5</span>.
Reaction comes only too swiftly, as is noted after all great revivals; for instance, the
years following the Welsh revival. Within a year or two after
Paul left Thessalonica discipline was sorely needed in the
church there, as we know from 1 and 2 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>The Gentile world was given over to immorality of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
sorts, and Judaism was deadened with formalism. It was no
easy task to make real spiritual life grow in such an atmosphere.
And yet this is precisely what Christianity undertakes
to do. Jesus came that men might have life, spiritual vitality,
and might have it abundantly (<span class="scripRef">John 10:10; 20:31</span>). James
is chiefly concerned that his readers may share in this new
life in Christ and may show the inner reality by the outward
expression. He never gets away from this central conception
of Christianity. The appearance of sin in hideous forms
among the followers of Jesus stirs James to intense indignation.
Mayor notes that the severity of tone in this paragraph
is accented by the absence of &ldquo;brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Origin of War (<span class="scripRef">4:1-2a</span>)</h3>
<p>James makes frequent use of the rhetorical question, as
here when he boldly demands the origin of the strife among
the churches of the Diaspora: &ldquo;Whence come wars and
whence come fightings among you?&rdquo; This use of question
gives life to style and is the mark of a good teacher. Note also
the repetition of &ldquo;whence,&rdquo; which gives added piquancy. In
the Epistle of Clement of Rome (<span class="scripRef">xlvi</span>) to the church at
Corinth (about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 97) he seems to refer to this passage in
James, where he asks: &ldquo;Wherefore are these strifes and
wraths, and factions and divisions, and war among you?&rdquo;
Basically, ecclesiastical strife does not differ in origin and
spirit from wars between nations. Sometimes there is even
more bitterness. Certainly no wars have been fiercer than
the so-called &ldquo;religious&rdquo; wars of history.</p>
<p>It does seem like irony that the two world wars should have
come after so many years of growth of the peace sentiment
in the world. But Christianity is on the side of peace, and
Christians must keep up the fight for peace. Jesus left a
legacy of peace for individuals and for nations who win it:
&ldquo;My peace I give unto you&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">John 14:27</span>). There has appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
one evidence of a better public opinion in the fact
that in the war each nation sought to justify itself in the eyes
of the world as not the aggressor but as being on the defensive.
This apology is some concession, at least to enlightened
Christian sentiment, which ultimately will banish war from
the earth along with slavery, alcohol, the brothel, and other
agencies of the devil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, James occupies the standpoint of the Christian
optimist, who fights for the highest and the best. So
Simon Peter writes: &ldquo;Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners
and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against
the soul&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:11</span>). We need not press the distinction
between wars and fightings, though the first means a state
of war and the lasting resentment connected with it, while
the second refers to battles or outbursts of passion which occur
during a state of war. James does not, of course, here refer
to wars between nations but to the factional bickerings in
the churches, the personal wrangles that embitter church
life. &ldquo;Among you,&rdquo; he adds, to drive the question home.</p>
<p>James answers his first question by a second. &ldquo;Come they
not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?&rdquo;
James sees an intimate connection between strife and laxity
of life. The case of the church at Corinth is a point where
factional divisions and gross immorality flourished together.
Plato (Phaedo 66) says: &ldquo;Wars and factions, and fightings
have no other source than the body and its lusts. For it is for
the getting of wealth that all our wars arise, and we are compelled
to get wealth because of our body, to whose service we
are slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James and Plato agree therefore in finding the origin of
war in the lusts of the body, but they differ in their opinion
as to how to treat the body. Plato exhorts neglect and scorn
of the body, while James urges the victory of the spirit over
the body. &ldquo;Plato has no idea that the body may be sanctified
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
here and glorified hereafter; he regards it simply as a necessary
evil, which may be minimized by watchfulness, but
which can in no way be turned into a blessing&rdquo; (Plummer).</p>
<p>The source of all war (private and public) is &ldquo;the pleasures
that war in your members.&rdquo; The same word for &ldquo;war&rdquo;
between the fleshly desires occurs in <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:11</span>, and in
<span class="scripRef">Romans 7:23</span> Paul uses it of the conflict between the two
laws of his nature. The word for &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; does not necessarily
mean sensual pleasures but that which is sweet and
leads to sinful strife (like ambition, love of money or power).
In <span class="scripRef">Titus 3:3</span> Paul combines both words, &ldquo;lusts and pleasures.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a>
&ldquo;The potential pleasure seated in each member constitutes
a hostile force, a foe lying in ambush against which
we have continually to be on our guard&rdquo; (Mayor).</p>
<p>In the <i>Letter of Aristeas</i><a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a> the question is asked: &ldquo;Why
do not the majority of men receive virtue?&rdquo; The answer is
given: &ldquo;Because all are naturally without self-control and
are bent on pleasures.&rdquo; It must be said that the philosophy
of hedonism in this sense of the term has a powerful hold
upon the average man. Buddha said trouble came of desire.</p>
<p>It is not an inspiring picture that James here draws, and
one would like to believe that he has a wider outlook than
the Christian community when he names his bill of particulars.
&ldquo;Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot
obtain: ye fight and war.&rdquo; Here Westcott and Hort make a
full stop in their text, and this is probably correct.</p>
<p>The presence of &ldquo;kill&rdquo; before &ldquo;covet&rdquo; gives a great deal of
trouble to the commentators, who find it an anticlimax.
Mayor urges the substitution of &ldquo;envy&rdquo; for &ldquo;kill,&rdquo; but there
is no manuscript authority for it, and the difficulty is not
really mended. Hort has the most probable solution by this
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
punctuation: &ldquo;Ye covet, and have not: ye commit murder.
And ye envy, and cannot attain: ye fight and war.&rdquo; At any
rate, the humiliating fact remains that lust, covetousness,
envy, fighting, and murder are here charged against some
of the readers of the epistle.</p>
<p>It looks as if some of them held to the view that they were
entitled to all that they could grasp, that Providence was
on the side of the heaviest battalions, that might constituted
right. &ldquo;Lust&rdquo; is here used in the most general sense, like
&ldquo;covet.&rdquo; The failure to find satisfaction leads to jealousy,
fighting, war, and even murder. Covetousness leads to fights
with individuals and nations. Lust in the narrow sense and
murder are common partners. The fight is on in every man&rsquo;s
life against all that is low and mean. He can keep a pure life
only by living the victorious life. There is also the common
oppression of the poor by the greedy and grasping in all the
ages. &ldquo;No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to
pledge: for he taketh a man&rsquo;s life to pledge&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 24:6</span>).
So Sirach (<span class="scripRef">34:21 f.</span>) says: &ldquo;He that taketh away his neighbour&rsquo;s
living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer
of his hire is a blood-shedder.&rdquo; The opposite of all this
pitiful business is seen in the nobility of love as portrayed in
<span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 13</span>.</p>
<h3>Asking Amiss (<span class="scripRef">4:2b-3</span>)</h3>
<p>The latter part of <span class="scripRef">verse 2</span>
is a puzzle to the commentators:
&ldquo;Ye have not, because ye ask not.&rdquo; Oesterley (following
Carr) thinks that we have a string of poetical quotations
(<i>stromateis</i>), &ldquo;not very skilfully strung together.&rdquo; Mayor
takes it as a mere repetition of &ldquo;ye lust, and have not&rdquo; and
says that it is not a further step. But surely James does not
mean to say that the one reason why the impulses to lust,
covetousness, envy, fighting, and murder are not gratified is
that men do not pray so as to carry their point with God and
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
man! That would make prayer a travesty and God a puppet
of man&rsquo;s evil desires.</p>
<p>I must believe that this sentence belongs to <span class="scripRef">verse 3</span> in
thought and should be so punctuated. We must always bear
in mind that the original Greek text had no punctuation and
that we are at liberty to punctuate <i>de novo</i> if the context
demands it. There is, no doubt, a backward look in &ldquo;ye
have not,&rdquo; but in reality James here starts a new topic, that
of prayer. There is a delicate hint in the use of the middle
voice here that they had not put their hearts into their prayers.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a>
&ldquo;Ye ask&rdquo; with the mere form of words and naturally &ldquo;receive
not,&rdquo; &ldquo;because ye ask amiss,&rdquo; &ldquo;wrongly,&rdquo; as in <span class="scripRef">John 18:23</span>.</p>
<p>Their prayers are vitiated by the evil purpose, &ldquo;that ye
may spend it in your pleasures,&rdquo; &ldquo;with the wicked intention
of spending it on your pleasures&rdquo; (Moffatt). Even Epictetus
(Cod. Vat. 3) says of the gods: &ldquo;And then shall they give to
thee the good things when thou rejoicest not in pleasure, but
in virtue.&rdquo; How often we all miss it in prayer! We ask for
what we should not, staking our judgment against that of
God. We ask with a spirit of rebellion and not of subjection
to the will of God (<span class="scripRef">4:7</span>). We ask, not for the glory of God nor
for the blessing of others, but for the gratification of our
own selfish pleasures, even when the things asked for are
good in themselves.</p>
<p>We may even get to the point where we dare ask God for
what is not good in itself. &ldquo;No asking from God which takes
place in a wrong frame of mind towards him or towards the
object asked has anything to do with prayer. It is an evil
asking&rdquo; (Hort). God cannot be made a private asset to further
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
our own selfish interests or to serve the wicked world
(cf. <span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 6:4 f.</span>). &ldquo;If we ask anything according to his will,
he heareth us&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 John 5:14</span>). The word in James for &ldquo;spend&rdquo;
means to consume, to waste, to dissipate. It is used of the
prodigal son who &ldquo;spent all&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 15:14</span>).</p>
<p>Prayer is probably the poorest of all our spiritual exercises.
It should be the most constant and the most helpful. It calls
for searching of heart and all sincerity. It is right and proper
to pray for our daily bread (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:11</span>), provided we do
our daily tasks so as to earn our daily bread. God does not
mean prayer to be a substitute for work. Trust is not anxiety
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:31</span>), but it is also not presumption. The use of
the name of Jesus does not cause the door of grace to spring
open for us unless we first put ourselves under the rule of
Jesus.</p>
<h3>The Friendship of the World (<span class="scripRef">4:4</span>)</h3>
<p>The words &ldquo;adulterers and&rdquo; of the Authorized Version are
not genuine, occurring in late documents. The sudden outburst
of &ldquo;ye adulteresses,&rdquo; &ldquo;wanton creatures&rdquo; (Moffatt),
leaves one in doubt whether James is singling out one special
form of sin so common in the world (Hort) or is using the
word in the figurative sense (Mayor) so frequent in the
Old Testament for the sin of idolatry (cf. <span class="scripRef">Psalm 73:27</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Ezek. 23:27</span>; <span class="scripRef">Hos. 2:2</span>; <span class="scripRef">Isa. 57</span>). Jesus denounced his age in
Palestine as &ldquo;an evil and adulterous generation&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 12:39</span>).
It will make good sense with either interpretation.</p>
<p>Oesterley argues that &ldquo;the depraved state of morals to
which the whole section bears witness must, in part at least,
have been due to the wickedness and co-operation of the
women, so that there is nothing strange in their being specifically
mentioned in connection with that form of sin with
which they would be more particularly associated.&rdquo; Such a
sin ought not, to be sure, to be found among Christians, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
<span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 5</span> shows how early it appeared in the church
in Corinth, a peculiarly licentious city.</p>
<p>The pressure of the easygoing, laissez-faire life of the
world on this point is hard upon true Christians in all the
ages. It is not merely that a double standard of morals is
claimed by men of the world for themselves, though denied
to their own wives, but they are aggressive against the virtue
of the daughters and wives of other men. This agelong evil is
condoned even by women of the world who are clean themselves,
in a blind surrender to the fact that men seem to be
hopelessly evil.</p>
<p>If the word &ldquo;adulteresses&rdquo; is here taken literally, as is
probable, James makes a bold appeal to women of pleasure
to cease from sin and to let God rule in their lives. It is surely
worthwhile to make such an appeal even to those who seem
to be hopelessly abandoned to the evil world. But it is pre-eminently
worthwhile to seek to warn, and to prevent from
ruin, the young men and women of our day. &ldquo;Know ye not,&rdquo;
says James with heat, &ldquo;that the friendship of the world is
enmity with God?&rdquo; Pastors sometimes find men and women
living in adultery and complacently keeping up their church
connections. James means to show the utter inconsistency of
such a course of conduct.</p>
<p>But if &ldquo;adulteresses&rdquo; is taken in the figurative sense, there
is still the friendship of the world that is enmity with God.
The friendship of the world is preferred to that of God.
&ldquo;World&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a> here is not the earth with all its beauty and charm
(God&rsquo;s world made by him; cf. <span class="scripRef">Psalm 19</span>), nor mankind, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
whom Christ died (<span class="scripRef">John 3:16</span>), but that world of selfish
pleasure and sin out of which Christ called his disciples and
which in turn hated them as it hated Christ (<span class="scripRef">John 15:18 ff.</span>).
This world will only love as a familiar friend those who cater
to its ideals and standards, who condone its slackness of
morals and neglect of God.</p>
<p>This cleavage between the wayward, wicked world and
the kingdom of God is a fact of the utmost significance
(<span class="scripRef">John 17:15 ff.</span>). The Christian has to learn the secret of
living in such a worldly atmosphere without being contaminated
by it. One does not wish to be considered a religious
crank and queer. He desires to have influence with his
friends and business acquaintances. But one cannot be a
&ldquo;hail fellow well met&rdquo; in sin and every form of worldly
indulgence and retain his influence for God. The time comes
when a choice must be made between friends, for that sort
of life in the world becomes incompatible with friendship
with God. One must make his choice. &ldquo;If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 John 2:15</span>).
One cannot run with the hare and the hounds. The devil
makes no objection to such a double life of hypocrisy, but
God does. God is gracious and forgiving to sinners who repent
but has no mercy for presumptuous sinners who defy
his kindness and keep in touch with the devil and his circles
of evil.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;enmity&rdquo; is the term for personal hostility. Preference
for sin constitutes a personal offense toward God,
who can have no rival, any more than a true wife can suffer
a rival in the affections of her husband. &ldquo;The mind of the
flesh is enmity against God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 8:7</span>). One must make his
choice. &ldquo;No man can serve two masters: for either he will
hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one,
and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:24</span>). Plummer argues clearly that James does not
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
condemn the scientist&rsquo;s love of nature or the sociologist&rsquo;s
enthusiasm, which is not always shared in by preachers as
much as is desirable.</p>
<p>Preaching often is so given to denunciation of sin that it
fails to exalt the possibilities of the right sort of manhood. It
thus repels the very men that it wishes to attract. So far from
that, love for man is one of the main proofs of love for God
(<span class="scripRef">1 John 4:20</span>). The passion for the souls of men is the true
mark of the redeemed. Paul (<span class="scripRef">Titus 2:12</span>) urges that &ldquo;denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live ... godly in
this present world&rdquo; (or &ldquo;age&rdquo; more exactly). &ldquo;Whosoever
therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself
an enemy of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;whoever, then, chooses to be the world&rsquo;s
friend turns enemy to God&rdquo; (Moffatt).</p>
<p>A person makes his choice as he is able to do by the exercise
of his own will and purpose. But once and finally made, he
renders himself <i>ipso facto</i> an enemy to God. There is no
help for it so long as God is really the God of purity and
righteousness. Josephus calls Poppea, the infamous wife of
Nero and proselyte to Judaism, a worshiper of God (<i>Ant.</i>
xx. 8. 11), but surely such &ldquo;worship&rdquo; was not acceptable to
God. James (<span class="scripRef">2:23</span>) has termed Abraham &ldquo;the friend of God,&rdquo;
but he entered into that relation to God on terms of obedience
to God as Lord. On no other terms is friendship with
God possible. It is not a question of one&rsquo;s feelings but of
the actual state of affairs. &ldquo;To be on terms of friendship with
the world involves living on terms of enmity with God&rdquo;
(Hort).</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; does not itself occur elsewhere in
the New Testament, though it is found several times in Proverbs;
but the words &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and to &ldquo;love as a friend&rdquo; are
common enough. Gildersleeve (<i>Justin Martyr</i>, p. 135) notes
that Xenophon uses the two verbs for love as synonymous.
But in the New Testament there is a distinction drawn in
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
<span class="scripRef">John 21:15-17</span>. The one is the &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; and richer word,
while the other is the &ldquo;more human.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> Certainly one has no
right to claim intimate family relationship with God as his
friend while at the same time living in adulterous relations
with the sinful world that hates God. The &ldquo;seductions of the
world&rdquo; (Plummer) are very real and very many, but surrender
to them is not constant with the fellowship of God.
The law of spiritual life is not always understood. Some
men wonder why they are not spiritually happy, why they
do not enjoy religion. They are living in sin with the world
and yet marvel at their lack of communion with God.</p>
<h3>The Yearning of the Spirit for Us (<span class="scripRef">4:5 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Or think ye?&rdquo; says James, as the alternative. Either the
friendship of the world is enmity with God or you think
&ldquo;that the scripture speaketh in vain.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, do you consider
this an idle word of Scripture?&rdquo; (Moffatt). This rhetorical
question expects an indignant denial. Therefore, the argument
holds that the friendship of the world is enmity with
God. But what is the Scripture? Is it only the passage in <span class="scripRef">verse 6</span>
that is referred to? The punctuation of the Revised Version
allows that. We have two questions before the one quotation.
But it may be that the general sense of Scripture is meant by
the first question. Usually &ldquo;the Scripture&rdquo; occurs before a
direct quotation, as in <span class="scripRef">Romans 4:3</span>.</p>
<p>Some would take the rest of <span class="scripRef">verse 5</span> after the first question
as a quotation, although no such quotation occurs in the Old
Testament. The general sense appears in various parts of
the Old Testament, as in <span class="scripRef">Exodus 20:5</span>: &ldquo;I am the Lord thy
God, a jealous God.&rdquo; Compare <span class="scripRef">Isaiah 63:8-16</span>; <span class="scripRef">Zechariah 8:2</span>.
Oesterley even sees a direct allusion to <span class="scripRef">Galatians 5:17, 21</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Romans 8:6, 8</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>, and an argument for
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
the late date of the Epistle of James. But this is forcing the
matter rather stiffly. The New Testament writers seem to
have used chains of quotations (catenae) as, for instance,
in <span class="scripRef">Romans 3:10-18</span>. Paul probably makes a free paraphrase
of <span class="scripRef">Isaiah 64:4</span> in <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>, and of <span class="scripRef">Isaiah 60:1-2</span> in
<span class="scripRef">Ephesians 5:14</span>. Either this is what is done here, or James is
already referring to <span class="scripRef">verse 6</span>, a quotation from <span class="scripRef">Proverbs 3:34</span>.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to take the second sentence in <span class="scripRef">verse 5</span>
as a question. We may follow the margin: &ldquo;The spirit which
he made to dwell in us he yearneth for even unto jealous
envy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;with jealousy doth He yearn after the spirit which
he causeth to dwell in us&rdquo; (Hort), or &ldquo;He yearns jealously
for the spirit he set within us&rdquo; (Moffatt). In one case (the
question) we take &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; as a subject and as the Holy
Spirit. In the other case (the affirmation) we take &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; as
object and as our redeemed spirit planted in us by God (cf.
<span class="scripRef">Rom. 8:4-16</span> for both ideas). In either rendering it is the
Spirit of God (cf. <span class="scripRef">Rom. 8:9</span>) who dwells in us and helps us
strive against the evil forces of the world in our own hearts.</p>
<p>God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts
(<span class="scripRef">Gal. 4:6</span>), who helps us in the fight with the flesh (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 5:16-26</span>).
It is the doctrine of the indwelling Spirit of God,
a very precious doctrine in the New Testament (<span class="scripRef">John 7:39; 16:7</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Rom. 8:11</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 3:16</span>; <span class="scripRef">Gal. 4:6</span>; <span class="scripRef">Eph. 3:17; 4:30</span>). The
Spirit of God has made his home in us. This is our glory and
our hope.</p>
<p>The word for &ldquo;yearn&rdquo; is a very strong one. It is the verb in
<span class="scripRef">Psalm 42:1</span>: &ldquo;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so
panteth my soul after thee, O God.&rdquo; Peter uses it of the longing
of newborn babes after the sincere milk of the word
(<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:2</span>). So Paul yearns after the Philippians (<span class="scripRef">1:8</span>).</p>
<p>There are many interpretations and many ways of punctuating
the words &ldquo;unto jealous envy&rdquo; or &ldquo;with jealousy.&rdquo;
We may not tarry over them. Probably the idea is that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
Holy Spirit covets our souls. He does not wish the devil to
have us. Usually this word for jealous envy has a bad sense,
but the context here makes it clear. God is a jealous God. He
can brook no rival in our hearts. God wishes the whole of our
heart&rsquo;s love, not just a part. He claims the rights of a loving
husband to all our heart&rsquo;s devotion. In our hours of doubt
and weakness &ldquo;the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be uttered&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 8:26</span>). We
may thank God that he is a jealous God for his people Israel.
He broods over his children with a mother&rsquo;s love, longing
for their growth and development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he giveth more grace&rdquo; (literally, &ldquo;greater grace&rdquo;),
&ldquo;yet he gives grace more and more&rdquo; (Moffatt). The words
&ldquo;giveth grace&rdquo; come from the quotation following (<span class="scripRef">Prov. 3:34</span>).
The effect of this jealous affection on God&rsquo;s part is not
to abandon us but to heap more and richer favors upon us.
God demands of us wholehearted surrender and service,
but he pours out the wealth of his love upon us. &ldquo;God resisteth
the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Septuagint quotation (see also <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 5:5</span>) is a free
translation of the idea in the Hebrew text. It is the striking
figure of God standing in the way, across the path of the
proud man who carries his head so high above others. He
will in due time be brought low. Pride goes before a fall, for
God is to be met along that road (cf. <span class="scripRef">Acts 18:6</span>; <span class="scripRef">Rom. 13:2</span>).
The man of the world feels no need of God and feels secure
and serene. But he reckons without his Host. God shows
favor to the humble (cf. the contrast in <span class="scripRef">1:10</span>).</p>
<p>The proud men think themselves the monopolists (Hort)
of divine favor, but they find out sooner or later that they
are passed by in favor of the man with lowliness of spirit and
nobility of life, who makes God, not the world, the Lord of
his life. This man God honors with far more grace than the
world can offer. He will have trouble (&ldquo;with persecutions&rdquo;),
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
no doubt, &ldquo;but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this
time,&rdquo; while &ldquo;in the world to come eternal life&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Mark 10:29 f.</span>).
The prince in God&rsquo;s kingdom and at his court is not
the man who wears the trappings of earthly rank and station
but the one who caught the spirit of Jesus and sought to do
good to all as he found opportunity. Plummer wonders if
James had not heard his mother recite the Magnificat. Certainly
he here echoes the same beautiful spirit.</p>
<h3>Choice Between God and the Devil (<span class="scripRef">4:7-8a</span>)</h3>
<p>It comes to this, that a man must decide whether or not
God is to rule his life. It is self or God, and that is the same
thing as the devil or God, for a self without God is ruled by
the devil. &ldquo;Be subject therefore unto God,&rdquo; since, as James
has shown in <span class="scripRef">verse 6</span>, God gives grace to the humble and
withstands the proud. &ldquo;The proud spirit has to be curbed&rdquo;
(Oesterley). Peter has expanded this idea in a great passage
(<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 5:6-9</span>). Our only hope is under the leadership of
God. The devil is the &ldquo;prince of the world&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">John 14:30</span>), and
he has plenty of help in the world rulers of darkness (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 6:11 f.</span>).
The proud and self-willed are sure to fall into his
condemnation (<span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 3:6</span>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But resist the devil.&rdquo; Take your stand (note the aorist
tense) in the face of the devil, the great hinderer and slanderer.
The fight is on between the forces of God and Satan,
and one must take sides. A man once said that he wished to
be impartial in the struggle between God and the devil. That
species of liberality is out of the question. He that is not
with Christ is against him. There is no middle ground.</p>
<p>James does not stop to parley over the existence of the
devil. He assumes the reality of the dread agent of evil, who
is bent on the destruction of all that is good in man. The
point to see clearly is that there is but one thing to do, and
that is to fight the devil, not with fire but with the word of
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
God, with the help of the Spirit of God. &ldquo;Get thee hence,
Satan,&rdquo; Jesus had to say (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 4:10</span>). &ldquo;And he will flee from
you.&rdquo; The devil will run if we fight him with the might of God.
One way to submit to God is to fight off the devil.</p>
<p>But it is not all negative. The converse is true also. &ldquo;Draw
nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.&rdquo; The Hebrew had
a technical term for drawing nigh to God for the purpose of
worship (<span class="scripRef">Ex. 19:22</span>; <span class="scripRef">Jer. 30:21</span>). It is not true that the devil is
irresistible and it is useless to oppose him (Plummer). This
is one of the pleas of the devil himself to break down the
resisting power of the human will and so to take all fight out
of us. The principle that James here announces is true to
Scripture, to psychology, and to human experience. If we
draw nigh to the devil, he will draw nigh to us. If we resist
him, he will flee from us. If we resist God, even God will
finally depart from us and leave us to our sins. If we approach
God in worship, he opens his heart to us. &ldquo;Return unto me,
and I will return unto you&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Zech. 1:3</span>). &ldquo;To this end was the
Son of man manifested, that he might destroy the works
of the devil&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 John 3:8</span>). &ldquo;The Lord is nigh unto all them
that call upon him&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 145:18, AV</span>). God first draws
nigh unto us (<span class="scripRef">John 16:16</span>), and when we respond, lo, he is
there before us. The place of safety and of power for the
Christian is the throne of grace. There he has a mighty
Friend and Helper (<span class="scripRef">Heb. 4:16</span>). We can draw close to God,
as a child to his father in the dark, and feel his presence.</p>
<h3>A Call to Repentance (<span class="scripRef">4:8b-10</span>)</h3>
<p>Here James speaks like one of the Old Testament prophets.
His epistle, while thoroughly Christian, is yet nearer to the
standpoint of the Old Testament prophets than any other
book in the New Testament. &ldquo;Cleanse your hands, ye sinners.&rdquo;
The priests washed their hands before they entered the
tabernacle to worship (<span class="scripRef">Ex. 30:19-21</span>; <span class="scripRef">Lev. 16:4</span>). It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
natural for the language to be applied to moral purity: &ldquo;I
will wash my hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
altar, O Jehovah&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 26:6</span>). See also <span class="scripRef">Hebrews 10:22</span>. So
Pilate sought to emphasize his own freedom from guilt by
washing his hands (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 27:24</span>), if by so doing he might
also soothe his own conscience. It is now as it has always
been: &ldquo;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who
shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and
a pure heart&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 24:3 f.</span>, AV).</p>
<p>The clean hands signify little in a moral sense&mdash;however
desirable for sanitary and other reasons&mdash;unless the heart is
also clean. Indeed, the Pharisees came to make the cleansing
of the hands a substitute for moral cleanness (<span class="scripRef">Mark 7:8 ff.</span>).
&ldquo;Purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.&rdquo; The word for purification
here is the common one for ceremonial cleansing
(<span class="scripRef">Ex. 19:10</span>), but the idea is figurative, as in <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 1:22</span> and
<span class="scripRef">1 John 3:3</span>. James seems to refer to <span class="scripRef">Psalm 73:13</span>. &ldquo;Wash you,
make you clean&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Isa. 1:16</span>). The double-minded (cf. <span class="scripRef">James 1:8</span>)
must no longer halt between two opinions. They must
forsake the world and give God the whole heart. It is a brave
word for reality in religion and against the hollow mockery of
mere lip service.</p>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">verse 9</span> we have a rather unusual exhortation for the
New Testament. The word for repentance does not mean
sorrow but change of mind and life. The need for a change
implies sorrow for the sins of one&rsquo;s life, to be sure. But one
may have sorrow and still not change his heart and life. The
thing that counts is the change, not the degree of the sorrow.
But, certainly, sorrow for sin is appropriate and natural for
the sinner who turns away from it. There is certainly room
for the appeal to &ldquo;be afflicted, and mourn, and weep&rdquo; (all
aorists with a note of urgency in the tense). One is reminded
of the &ldquo;woe&rdquo; of Jesus in <span class="scripRef">Luke 6:25</span>. We have here a
call to the godly sorrow described in <span class="scripRef">2 Corinthians 7:10</span>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
There is a time to laugh and a time to mourn; yes, and a time
for laughter to be turned to mourning and even for joy to
be turned into heaviness, like the poor publican with downcast
eyes in the Temple before God (<span class="scripRef">Luke 18:13</span>). &ldquo;The
words express the contrast between the loud unseemly gaiety
of the pleasure-seeker, and the subdued mien and downcast
look of the penitent&rdquo; (Oesterley).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord.&rdquo; This is the
only proper attitude for the sinner, whether saved or unsaved.
See the same figure in <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 5:6</span>. The proud Pharisee
in <span class="scripRef">Luke 18:11</span> is the picture of all that worship should not be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he shall exalt you.&rdquo; This is the law of grace, as is
often stated by Jesus: &ldquo;Every one that exalteth himself shall
be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Luke 14:11</span>). But the man that humbles himself before the
eye of the Lord must do so because of real apprehension of
his own sin and need of forgiveness, not for the purpose of
future exaltation to be obtained by momentary self-abnegation.
The delicate balance of motives here is preserved. The
promise will come true only if the person really turns to the
Lord with sincerity of heart. Nothing is more needed today
than this prostration before God.</p>
<h3>Captious Criticism (<span class="scripRef">4:11 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>Moffatt places these verses just after <span class="scripRef">2:13</span>, since this seems
to have been its original place. This is the position also given
by Oesterley. And yet it is quite possible that James here
merely recurs to the subject of the loose tongue, as he had
already done once (cf. <span class="scripRef">1:26; 3:2 ff.</span>). See also <span class="scripRef">5:12</span>. He has
one word more on this burning topic, a sort of postscript on
the tongue, an extremely difficult subject to say the last word
about. &ldquo;Speak not one against another, brethren.&rdquo; The tense
of the verb (present durative) implies that some of them
had been doing precisely this thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>It is so easy to &ldquo;talk down on one,&rdquo; to act as critic (cf. <span class="scripRef">Matt. 7:1</span>)
of one&rsquo;s brother in Christ. We cannot help forming
opinions of each other, but we can avoid captious criticism,
sharp and needless censure. The point made by James is that
this habit assumes the right to judge the very law of God. It
is far easier to play the part of critic of the law than to be a
doer of the law. Destructive criticism is always the cheaper
exercise and the more useless. Constructive criticism is
more creative and much harder.</p>
<p>There is one supreme Lawgiver and Judge, &ldquo;he who is
able to save and destroy.&rdquo; This power belongs to God, the
Creator (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 10:28</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 6:9</span>), not to man, the creature.
The critic of the law prefers to find flaws in the law rather
than to undertake to obey it. He assumes that he can enact a
better law, but it is all assumption. James shows his impatience
with such criticism by saying, &ldquo;But who art thou
that judgest thy neighbor?&rdquo; See <span class="scripRef">Romans 14:4</span>. In common
law we are to give every man the benefit of the doubt and to
assume his innocence till his guilt is proven. But in current
speech the sharp tongue follows no such rule of reason but
creates suspicion and sows hate and strife at every turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c11">XI
<br />God and Business</h2>
<p>The arrogance of the sinful heart is clearly shown in <span class="scripRef">4:13</span>
to <span class="scripRef">5:6</span>. Such a heart prefers worldliness to the worship of
God (see <span class="scripRef">4:1-10</span>) and flippantly criticizes one&rsquo;s neighbors
with lighthearted satisfaction with self and a positive love of
faultfinding (<span class="scripRef">4:11 f.</span>). This easy arrogance faces the future
with unconcern. No look Godward is taken in business ventures.
James &ldquo;opposes the irreligious sense of travelling merchants&rdquo;
(Windisch). These Jews of the Diaspora had come
to have a considerable part of the business of the Roman
Empire. They professed to be servants of God, but in practice
they often denied and ignored the God of their
fathers.</p>
<h3>Leaving God Out (<span class="scripRef">4:13-15</span>)</h3>
<p>One may hope that James alludes to the Jewish merchants,
not Jewish Christians. Certainly those Jewish merchants
who became Christians continued their business, though not
in a godless fashion. The merchant has one of the most useful
and most honorable of all callings, but it seems clear that
some of the Jewish merchants had already brought disfavor
upon the business by their sharp practices. See <span class="scripRef">Sirach 26:29</span>.
&ldquo;A merchant will hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and
a huckster will not be declared free from sin.&rdquo; This piece of
moralizing is evidently occasioned by some tricks in trade
indulged in by Jewish merchants. One is bound to admit
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
that some modern Jews retain some of the same reputation in
certain lines of trade.</p>
<p>But the point that James makes is a peril to Christian merchants
also. The keen competition in all kinds of business is
a constant temptation to violate the Golden Rule and to ignore
God as well as the welfare of one&rsquo;s customers in order to
make money and to meet a rival who is unscrupulous in trade.
The Christian businessman today can do business on a high
plane. Hustle and enterprise need not condescend to underhand
methods. It is a pleasure to note the activity of the
Gideons, an organization of Christian men who, besides doing
other useful things, have placed copies of the Bible in
the rooms of most American hotels. These men have not
left God out.</p>
<p>In Palestine the Jews held on to the agricultural life, but
in the Diaspora they were merchants and bankers. Philo (In
Flaccum VIII) gives a picture of the Jewish merchants and
bankers in Alexandria. Josephus (Ant. XII, 2-5) alludes to
the Jewish traveling merchant about 175 <span class="small">B.C.</span> One of the wonders
of history is how the Jews, scattered over the world,
finally without a land of their own, have yet by their wits
maintained themselves as a race and a religion and have
been leaders in business, in art, in music, in politics, in
literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, ye that say&rdquo; is the impatient challenge of
James to those who leave God out of account in their plans
for the future. The tone of impatience is due to the conviction
that one should be so conscious of his own weakness as not to
boast about the future. &ldquo;To-day or tomorrow we will go into
this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain.&rdquo;
And then we shall move on to the next town and work that
with our wares, for all the world like a modern &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo; or
secondhand clothing store with its bankruptcy or fire features.
The picture is drawn from life. The use of &ldquo;this city&rdquo; is
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
merely typical, as if James were pointing it out on the map
(Mayor), and is more vivid than &ldquo;such and such a city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">James 1:11</span> we read that the rich man shall &ldquo;fade away
in his goings,&rdquo; an allusion to the travels of the rich merchants.
We see the rapid movements of the Jewish Christians illustrated
by the travels of Aquila and Priscilla, who came
from Rome to Corinth (<span class="scripRef">Acts 18:1 f.</span>), then to Ephesus (<span class="scripRef">18:18</span>),
to Rome again (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 16:3</span>), and back to Ephesus
(<span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 4:19</span>). The phrase &ldquo;spend a year there&rdquo; is literally
&ldquo;do a year there,&rdquo; and the idiom occurs also in <span class="scripRef">Acts 15:33; 20:3</span>
(cf. <span class="scripRef">Prov. 13:23</span>).</p>
<p>The wide dispersion of the Jews all over the Roman Empire
gave them business connections that made it easy to get
new business and to hold the old trade. The very word here
for &ldquo;trade&rdquo; means to travel into a region to get business, just
like a modern commercial traveler. Our word &ldquo;emporium&rdquo; is
just this word. The Jews made the very Temple itself &ldquo;a
house of merchandise.&rdquo; So then trading implied traveling for
business (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 22:5</span>).</p>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">2 Peter 2:3</span> a somber light is thrown by this same word:
&ldquo;And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And get gain.&rdquo; This is the climax of the
whole, the aim of the journeys and the trading. &ldquo;The frequent
conjunctions separate the different items of the plan, which
are rehearsed thus one by one with manifest satisfaction.
The speakers gloat over the different steps of the programme
which they have arranged for themselves&rdquo; (Plummer). There
is no harm in planning to make money or in travel for that
purpose. The harm lies in the complete ignoring of God in all
their plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
&ldquo;you who know nothing about to-morrow&rdquo; (Moffatt). James
has ample authority in this statement. &ldquo;Boast not thyself of
to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Prov. 27:1</span>). The prohibition implies a carelessness about
the future that grew out of indifference to God. There is a
rabbinical saying (<i>Sanhed.</i> 100<i>b</i>) to this effect: &ldquo;Care not for
the morrow, for ye know not what a day may bring forth.&rdquo;
James is condemning those who make their plans for the future
with God left out, as if all were in their own hands.
Jesus spoke the wonderful parable of the rich fool for the
benefit of two brothers who were quarreling over the estate:
&ldquo;Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take
thine ease, eat, drink, be merry&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 12:19</span>).</p>
<p>This was the worldly-wise view of the Cyrenaics and the
Epicureans, and it is the standpoint of multitudes of modern
men who under the influence of monism (like Haeckel)
deny the existence of a personal God or who act as if there
were no God (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 14:1</span>). But God replies to the fool,
&ldquo;Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee;
and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they
be?&rdquo; Jesus does not contradict this position when he says:
&ldquo;Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow
will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:34</span>). He is here condemning overanxiety,
that is as distrustful of God as reckless unconcern. There is
the golden mean of calm trust in God.</p>
<p>We are not to live in a haphazard manner, without plan or
purpose. We are to make plans, but we must put God into
our preparations. It is cowardly to be superstitious in the
anticipation of evil. Some people knock on wood if they happen
to boast a bit. Others are superstitious about the number
thirteen, about Friday, about the moon, and a hundred other
hallucinations. The point with these Jews is not worry or
superstition but irreligion. There are multitudes of practical
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
pagans today who fear not God nor regard man. They carry
on their business with no fear of consequences for their evil
practices. They wreck a bank or a railroad with equal nonchalance
and care not for the suffering caused thereby in the
homes of the poor.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we are ignorant of the morrow. We do
not know the weather of the morrow with certainty, in spite
of our gauges and forecasts. Many railroad accidents are due
to the unknown elements in the problems of travel. A faulty
rail, a broken tie, a weakened wheel, a rolling stone, a careless
brakeman, a sleeping switchman, a malicious robber&mdash;a
hundred and one things may happen, any one of which will
cause death to helpless victims. &ldquo;The best laid schemes o&rsquo;
mice and men gang aft a-gley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uncertainty of life is one of the things that a wise man
must consider and face. A clot of blood on the brain may
cause instant and unexpected death. The heart, driven too
hard, may suddenly cease to beat. &ldquo;What is your life?&rdquo; He
does not mean manner of life or the life principle or eternal
life. The question concerns all, the good and the wicked
alike. The question as to the character of life pertains to its
brevity and uncertainty on earth. &ldquo;For ye are a vapor,&rdquo; &ldquo;you
are but a mist&rdquo; (Moffatt). The word is common for smoke, as
the &ldquo;smoke of a furnace&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 19:28</span>), &ldquo;vapor of smoke&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 2:19</span>; from <span class="scripRef">Joel 2:30</span>), steam or breath; so our &ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo;
Job lamented (<span class="scripRef">7:7</span>): &ldquo;Oh remember that my life
is a breath.&rdquo; We are &ldquo;a vapor that appeareth for a little time,
and then vanisheth away.&rdquo; Aristotle (Hist. An. vi. 7) uses
these two verbs of the appearance and the disappearance of
a flock of birds as they sweep across the sky. The usage occurs
also of the eclipse of the sun. The transitoriness of human
life should lead to full and hearty recognition of God, not to
careless slighting of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that ye ought to say&rdquo; (more exactly, &ldquo;instead of your
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
saying&rdquo;), &ldquo;If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or
that.&rdquo; James does not, of course, mean that one should always
say these words. That gets to be cant or mere claptrap. It becomes
repellent to hear one use the name of God flippantly
and constantly. Besides, it comes to signify little or nothing,
as one may count his beads or say his Pater Nosters with no
regard to what he is doing. There should be significance in
our acts and words of worship.</p>
<p>The Jews made a point not to use the name of God too
familiarly. They often used &ldquo;the Name&rdquo; for God, and Christians
came to refer to Christ in the same way, &ldquo;for the Name&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Acts 5:41</span>). The late Jews came, perhaps under Mohammedan
influence, to use the formula &ldquo;if the Name wills&rdquo;
when about to start upon a journey (Oesterley). The rabbis
(Plummer) have a story of a Jewish father who, at the circumcision
of his son, boasts that with seven-year-old wine
he would celebrate for a long time the birth of his son. That
night Rabbi Simeon meets the Angel of Death and asks him,
&ldquo;Why art thou thus wandering about?&rdquo; The angel replies:
&ldquo;Because I slay those who say, &lsquo;We will do this or that,&rsquo; and
think not how soon death may come upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing that matters is for us to have the right attitude
of heart toward God, not the chattering of a formula. God
does not have to be propitiated by a charm or amulet. God
should be the silent partner in all our plans and work, to be
consulted, to be followed whenever his will is made known.
Paul frequently spoke of his plans, sometimes mentioning
God, as in <span class="scripRef">Acts 18:21</span> (God willing), <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 4:19</span> (if
the Lord will), and <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 16:7</span> (if the Lord permit);
but also with no mention of God in words, as in <span class="scripRef">Acts 19:21</span>;
<span class="scripRef">Romans 15:28</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>. But always Paul felt that
his movements were &ldquo;in the Lord,&rdquo; as in <span class="scripRef">Philippians 2:24</span>.
He never left God out of his life. Indeed, he practiced the
presence of God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h3>Conscious Opposition (<span class="scripRef">4:16</span>)</h3>
<p>It is bad enough to ignore God, as so many men do. A
slight is almost as hard to bear as an insult. However, a positive
refusal to do God&rsquo;s known will is worse. &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; as is
really the case (cf. <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 14:6</span>), &ldquo;But here you are&rdquo; (Moffatt),
instead of your trust in God, &ldquo;ye glory in your vauntings.&rdquo;
In their pride of life (<span class="scripRef">1 John 2:16</span>) they practically
defied God. The word meant originally a wanderer about the
country, a vagabond, a Scottish landlouper, a swaggerer, an
imposter, a braggart. In <span class="scripRef">Job 41:34</span> we find the &ldquo;sons of pride.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And I exalted not myself in arrogance&rdquo; (Test. Joseph XVII, 8).
And Jesus said, &ldquo;I am among you as he that serveth&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Luke 22:27</span>, AV).</p>
<p>These men were exalting themselves at the expense of God.
They were running against the known will of God. One of the
rabbis says, &ldquo;It is revealed and known before Thee that our
will is to do Thy will&rdquo; (<i>Berachoth</i>, 17<i>a</i>). &ldquo;All such glorying
is evil,&rdquo; says James. It is not wicked per se to boast (cf. <span class="scripRef">1:9</span>),
but such boasting as mentioned is wicked. It is not impossible
to know the will of God if one will pay the price. &ldquo;If any man
willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether
it is of God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">John 7:17</span>). The way opens to the one who is
willing to put God to the test. &ldquo;The boaster forgets that life
depends on the will of God&rdquo; (Mayor).</p>
<h3>Negative Sin (<span class="scripRef">4:17</span>)</h3>
<p>In a way this verse is a summary of the entire epistle
(cf. <span class="scripRef">1:22; 2:14; 3:1, 13; 4:11</span>). Hence James&rsquo;s &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; is
quite in point. Moffatt places this verse at the end of <span class="scripRef">chapter 2</span>.
Spitta, however, finds no connection in the context and
takes it as a familiar quotation. This may indeed be a reference
to the words of Jesus in <span class="scripRef">Luke 12:47</span>: &ldquo;That servant, who
knew his lord&rsquo;s will, and made not ready, nor did according
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.&rdquo; There is an
excusable ignorance or at least a mollifying ignorance (cf.
<span class="scripRef">Luke 12:48</span>; <span class="scripRef">Acts 3:17</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 1:13</span>). There is palliation for
unconscious sins. But James is dealing with failure to obey
the will of God. It is conscious and wilful sin, but of the
negative kind.</p>
<p>These sins of omission (<i>peccata omissionis</i>) are treated
lightly by many people. The Talmud in general takes this
easy position on the subject. Oesterley quotes the Jerusalem
Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> viii, 6) on <span class="scripRef">Zephaniah 1:12</span>: &ldquo;I will search
Jerusalem with candles, and I will punish the men,&rdquo; which
adds: &ldquo;not by daylight, nor with the torch, but with candles,
so as not to detect venial sins.&rdquo; But he adds this also (<i>Shabbath</i>, 54<i>b</i>):
&ldquo;Whosoever is in a position to prevent sins being
committed in his household, but refrains from doing so, becomes
liable for their sins.&rdquo; And in <span class="scripRef">1 Samuel 12:23</span> we read,
&ldquo;God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to
pray for you&rdquo; (AV).</p>
<p>Jesus made it plain that he considered sins of omission as
real sins: &ldquo;These ye ought to have done, and not to have left
the other undone&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 23:23</span>). Hear his tragic words to
the deluded sinner at the judgment bar: &ldquo;I was hungry, and
ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no
drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye
clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 25:42 f.</span>). The repetition of &ldquo;not&rdquo; here is like the tolling
of a bell. Hear then James: &ldquo;To him therefore that
knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&rdquo; So
also Paul urged the Galatians not to grow weary in doing the
good or beautiful (<span class="scripRef">Gal. 6:9</span>).</p>
<p>It is so easy to shut one&rsquo;s eyes and not to see the opportunities
for service. It is so easy to let prejudice blind us to the
needs of the real neighbor, as the priest and the Levite
passed by on the other side and left the poor wounded man
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
to suffer (<span class="scripRef">Luke 10:31 f.</span>). The point that James is anxious to
make is that this blindness is sin. The man who has learned
how to do the high and noble deed and then falls short has
committed a sin. It is a heavy indictment that is here drawn
against us. We are charged with not coming up to the standard
of our highest knowledge. Plummer comments pertinently
on the Roman Catholic doctrine of probabilism,
which seeks to excuse the weakness of the flesh and to justify
a person in his preference of the lower in the presence of
the higher. &ldquo;So long as it is not certain that the act in question
is forbidden it may be permitted.&rdquo; Plummer adds, &ldquo;The
moral law is not so much explained as explained away.&rdquo;
Alphonse de Sarasa wrote on &ldquo;The Art of Perpetual Enjoyment&rdquo;
(<i>Ars Semper Gaudendi</i>), a piece of special pleading
for the indulgence of the flesh. &ldquo;The good is the enemy of
the best,&rdquo; and the bad is the enemy of the good. Down the
steps we go to the bottom of the ladder.</p>
<h3>Tainted Wealth (<span class="scripRef">5:1-3</span>)</h3>
<p>Oesterley finds proof of the &ldquo;patchwork&rdquo; character of the
epistle in the five paragraphs of the closing chapter. But in a
&ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; book one does not expect direct connection between
the paragraphs. That is not true of the practical portions
of the Pauline epistles. In the first eleven verses of this
chapter the eschatological standpoint is occupied, possibly
that of Jewish eschatology in <span class="scripRef">1-6</span>
and that of Christian eschatology
in <span class="scripRef">7-11</span> (Oesterley).
Note &ldquo;in the last days&rdquo; in <span class="scripRef">verse 3</span>.</p>
<p>James is familiar with the prophetic imagery of the messianic
times in apocalyptic style but is very pointed in his
courageous indictment of the follies and iniquities of the
wicked rich. Johnstone entitles this paragraph &ldquo;the woes of
the wicked rich.&rdquo; Mayor says, &ldquo;It is not the careless worldliness
of the bustling trader which is condemned, but the
more deadly worldliness of the unjust capitalist or landlord.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
In <span class="scripRef">verse 7</span> James seems to contrast &ldquo;the brethren&rdquo; with the
rich of <span class="scripRef">verses 1-6</span>. It is worthwhile to quote <span class="scripRef">Isaiah 33:1</span>: &ldquo;Woe
to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee!
when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and
when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
shall deal treacherously with thee&rdquo; (AV). And <span class="scripRef">Habakkuk 2:9</span>:
&ldquo;Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that
he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from
the hand of evil!&rdquo; Note also the book of Enoch: &ldquo;Woe to
those that build their houses with sin&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">94:7</span>); &ldquo;Woe unto
you mighty who violently oppress the righteous, for the day
of your destruction will come&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">96:8</span>).</p>
<p>Perhaps there is an allusion to the words of Jesus against
the Pharisees (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 23:13-36</span>). The Gospel of Luke is held
by some to have an Ebionitic tendency because it preserves
some plain words of Jesus to, and about, the rich (<span class="scripRef">6:24; 18:24</span>).
But Jesus is not hostile toward the rich, for he had
friends and followers from the wealthy classes, although he
dealt very squarely and honestly with them. Some Jews held
that all the rich were wicked, as some modern socialists and
anarchists do. But certainly Jesus did not fawn upon the rich
or curry favor with them by flattery or compromise. It is easy
to denounce classes of men en masse. It requires perspicacity
and courage to discriminate, to be just, and to seek to remedy
real ills. The rich Jews had already oppressed the Christians
and made the conditions of life hard.</p>
<p>The Christians were helpless for any immediate relief.
They had little or no power in government and had to live
in the social and economic atmosphere created by those
hostile to them. It was not a democratic but an imperialistic
age. In holding out the consolation that rectification of these
grave evils will take place at the second coming of Christ,
James does not mean to condone the present situation or to
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
acquiesce in it. But what cannot be cured can be endured.</p>
<p>Christianity has had a long and hard fight in the effort to
alleviate the sufferings of the poor. Ofttimes grasping men
of money have used the very church itself as a means of
oppression instead of an agent of blessing. It is a sad state
when men and women with real social wrongs come to feel
that Christianity is a negative factor in their struggle or a
positive hindrance to success.</p>
<p>James turns upon these oppressors: &ldquo;Come now, ye rich,
weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.&rdquo;
This &ldquo;come now&rdquo; is like that in <span class="scripRef">4:13</span>. &ldquo;Weep and shriek,&rdquo;
Moffatt has it. The word is an onomatopoetic word and is
used only of violent grief, as in <span class="scripRef">Isaiah 13:6</span>; <span class="scripRef">4:31</span>. It does not
occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The apocalyptic
writings have a good deal to say about the miseries that were
coming upon them (cf. <span class="scripRef">Joel 2:10 ff.</span>; <span class="scripRef">Zech. 14:6 ff.</span>; <span class="scripRef">Dan. 12:1</span>).
The Gospels connect them also with the Day of the
Lord (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 24-25</span>; <span class="scripRef">Mark 13:14-27</span>; <span class="scripRef">Luke 21:9-19</span>). Part of
the Gospel prophecies were fulfilled in the destruction of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your riches are corrupted,&rdquo; &ldquo;your wealth lies rotting&rdquo;
(Moffatt). The perfect tense presents the state of rottenness.
This ill-gotten gain will not keep; it is already putrid. There
is such a thing as tainted money&mdash;blood money wrung from
the oppressed toilers; money gained by financial legerdemain
(high finance) at the expense of helpless stockholders, whose
stock is watered for the benefit of the few in control; money
made out of the souls and bodies of men and women in the
saloon and the white slave traffic.</p>
<p>The ethics of money-making is a large question and a vital
one in modern life. It is raised in an acute form by this passage.
Christians cannot afford to make money by crushing
the life out of business rivals on the juggernaut principle.
The Golden Rule ought to work in business. Christ claims
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
control of money and the making of money. The Christian
who acts on the &ldquo;bulkhead,&rdquo; or compartment, principle of
life and keeps his money in a separate bulkhead into which
he does not allow Christ to enter is disloyal to Christ. Christ
claims the right of a partner in our business, not a silent but
an active partner. We are in business with Christ and for
Christ. The Christian has no right to have rotten riches. He
should have clean money, not filthy lucre. Sound money is
more than mere phrase. Money represents labor, and labor
is the sweat of brain and brawn. The gambler cannot offer
clean money to God. He has robbed a man of his money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your garments are moth-eaten.&rdquo; We have the prophetic
perfect here, and James sees the outcome as a reality in a state
of completion. It is a vivid picture of fine clothes eaten by
moths and full of holes, ruined beyond repair. In the East
these rich garments were handed down as heirlooms from
generation to generation and often formed a considerable
part of the wealth of a rich man. Paul refers to this when he
said, &ldquo;I coveted no man&rsquo;s silver, or gold, or apparel&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 20:33</span>).
The picture of an old moth-eaten garment is forlorn
in the extreme. &ldquo;Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,
like a garment that is moth-eaten&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Job 13:28</span>). A
plutocrat is subject to the fate of all mortals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your gold and your silver are rusted,&rdquo; &ldquo;lie rusted over&rdquo;
(Moffatt). As a matter of fact, gold does not rust in the ordinary
sense, except by chemicals, though silver tarnishes
rather easily. However, this verb is used in <span class="scripRef">Sirach 12:11</span> of a
mirror dimmed with rust; but the Hebrew word is used also
of filth. A dirty mirror is one of the ugliest sights. James is
using popular language, to be sure, and is not to be held to
the terminology of science. But scientists themselves hardly
know how to use language accurately, since radium is found
to break down the lines between metals and transmutation
actually occurs like the alchemy of the ancients.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>In <span class="scripRef">James 3:8</span> this word for &ldquo;rust&rdquo; is used for poison. At any
rate, decay rests on all mortal things. It is not necessary to
wait for the Day of the Lord to see this fact. &ldquo;Their rust
shall be for a testimony against you.&rdquo; There will be no
escape from this telltale rust which, like gray hairs, betrays
age and the approach of death. &ldquo;And shall eat your flesh as
fire.&rdquo; Westcott and Hort place &ldquo;as fire&rdquo; with the next sentence.
Either punctuation makes good sense, but it is a
bolder figure used as mentioned, for nothing eats up what it
seizes upon more rapidly or completely than fire. Feeding the
flames of a furnace, as a stoker in a great ship, is one of the
most exhaustive of all tasks. Fire licks up all in its reach and
will gut modern fireproof buildings (iron and concrete)
when once it gets started. The plural here emphasizes the
completeness of the work of destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.&rdquo; These
wicked rich have heaped up treasure like a thesaurus and in
the end of the day have seen it turn to dust and ashes,
crumbling between their fingers. There is no vault on earth
secure against moth, rust, and thieves (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 6:19</span>). Those
who set their hearts upon the wealth of earth are bound to
come to grief. Pitiful is the state of the man &ldquo;that layeth up
treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 12:21</span>).
The only wealth that lasts is riches toward God, and
this is open to us all. The only wise use of money is in making
friends who will welcome us (<span class="scripRef">Luke 16:9</span>) into the eternal
tabernacles. The mammon of unrighteousness may be so employed.
If it is not, one will find that he has simply treasured
up wrath against the day of wrath, to be paid at last with
compound interest (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 2:5</span>).</p>
<h3>Wronged Workers (<span class="scripRef">5:4</span>)</h3>
<p>The God of all the earth will do right. He is not deaf to
the cries of those oppressed millions in the ages whose piteous
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
appeals for elemental justice come to him. This is a terrible
indictment of Jewish capitalists who withheld the
meager wages of the men who gathered the harvests. &ldquo;Behold,
the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields, which
is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out.&rdquo; The hire of the
laborers reminds one of the proverb, &ldquo;The laborer is worthy
of his hire&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Luke 10:7</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Tim. 5:18</span>). The word for &ldquo;hire&rdquo;
occurs sometimes in the sense of reward (e.g., <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 3:8, 14</span>),
but the original idea is that of pay for work done (e.g., <span class="scripRef">Matt. 20:8</span>),
and so here.</p>
<p>The word for laborer means any kind of workman, but it
is common in the New Testament for agricultural workers.
&ldquo;The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few&rdquo;
(<span class="scripRef">Matt. 9:37</span>). When the work is done, it is only simple
justice for the workman to receive his pay, for the hungry
mouths at home have to be filled.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the cause of the workman was
guarded with special care: &ldquo;Thou shalt not oppress a hired
servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren,
or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy
gates: in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall
the sun go down upon it ... lest he cry against thee unto
Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 24:14 f.</span>). See also
<span class="scripRef">Malachi 3:5</span>: &ldquo;I will be a swift witness against ... those
that oppress the hireling in his wages.&rdquo; Tobit charges his son
Tobias, &ldquo;Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought
for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Tobit 4:14</span>).
Sirach (<span class="scripRef">34:21 f.</span>) says, &ldquo;The bread of the needy is the
life of the poor: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of
blood. He that taketh away his neighbor&rsquo;s living slayeth
him; and he that defraudeth a laborer of his hire is a blood-shedder.&rdquo;
Certainly, therefore, the Jews were not without
explicit teaching on this vital point of elemental social justice.</p>
<p>And yet these men &ldquo;who mowed&rdquo; (literally, &ldquo;heap
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
together&rdquo;)<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> their fields had the sad experience of not receiving
the wages, &ldquo;of you kept back by fraud, comes too late
from you&rdquo; (Mayor). The word means to &ldquo;fall short,&rdquo; &ldquo;be too
late.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
<p>The honest laborers who form the foundation of our industrial
system are not to be treated as beggars or hobos.
They are not subjects for charity. They are the human element
in the industrial problem. Blood is thicker than water
and is more valuable than gold. The horror of war is that it
treats men as fodder for cannon, regardless of the result to
the man or those dependent on him.</p>
<p>This stolen pay &ldquo;cries out&rdquo; and ought to cry out, whether
the hire is kept back after the work is done or whether the
employer purposely squeezes the laborer down to starvation
wages in order to make more money for himself. There is a
just balance to be struck by which both capital and labor
may receive fair remuneration. &ldquo;The cries of them that
reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cries of the harvesters&rdquo; (Moffatt) are musical when
they sing together as they work, content with their wages
and joyous in their work. But the cries here heard are of a
very different sort. They are the angry, resentful outcries of
men who have been wronged in their very souls by those
who should have been their protectors and friends, those
for whom the harvesters have worked. These men cry to
heaven, and they ought to do so. Mayor notes four sins that
cry to heaven: a brother&rsquo;s blood (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 4:10</span>), the sin of
Sodom (<span class="scripRef">Gen. 18:20</span>), the oppressed hireling (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 24:15</span>),
and the cry of Job for justice (<span class="scripRef">Job 16:18 f.</span>). But men ought
to hear the cry of the laborers before they become too clamorous.
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
It is only right that social injustice should be rectified
here and now and the transgressors punished.</p>
<p>The social test of modern Christianity is to do justice to
the laboring men without doing injustice to the capitalists.
The conditions of life must be made easier. If corporations
have no souls, the men who toil at the forge have. Men are
entitled to a bit of heaven here and now at their own hearth
and home. Somehow, many of the laborers have come to feel
that the churches do not sympathize with the struggles of the
laboring classes to better their hard lot but fawn upon the
very rich who sometimes grind the toilers to the earth. It is
easy to be extreme and unjust to one side or the other. The
main thing is to be faithful to God and man, to man as
man. The poorest of men is worth more than a sheep, yes,
than gold and silver. The soul is without price, and the soul
dwells in the body. We must shake the shackles free from
men and women who cry out to God. The Lord God of
Sabaoth has heard their cries and will punish the offenders in
due time, but that fact does not absolve us from our present
duty in the midst of conditions that call for action. Wronged
workers have a right to a hearing at the bar of public opinion.
They will cry on until they are heard.</p>
<h3>The Wanton Use of Money (<span class="scripRef">5:5 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>Evidently James is all ablaze as he faces the situation of
his readers. These Jewish plutocrats, some of them shysters,
have made their money out of the blood and sweat of the
toiling poor. And then they spend it in a way to anger the
wronged workers still more. They live in the most luxurious
extravagance and waste of money while the cold, half-naked,
hungry toilers who made the wealth go unpaid. It is no wonder
that such laborers grow bitter at heart. It is a vivid and
even ghastly picture of the wicked rich who revel at the cost
of human happiness, who with careless indifference shut
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
their eyes to the misery all around them due to their own injustice.
Christianity endeavors to make this cold cynicism
impossible, to persuade to be just and, if need be, go the second
mile in eagerness to help rather than to hang back and
higgle over the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your
pleasure, ye have revelled on earth and plunged into
dissipation&rdquo; (Moffatt). The sound of revelry by night has
no melody to the ears of the man whose wife and children are
starving because he does not get a square deal from his employer.
In Hermas (<span class="scripRef"><i>Sim.</i> 7. 1</span>) both of these verbs are used
together (&ldquo;reminiscence of this passage,&rdquo; Mayor) of those
who gave themselves up to the lusts of the world. See also
<span class="scripRef">1 Timothy 5:6</span>: &ldquo;She that giveth herself to pleasure is dead
while she liveth.&rdquo; One is reminded of the picture of the beggar
Lazarus who lay at the rich man&rsquo;s gate while the man
feasted within. The conditions will be reversed in heaven if
the poor are Christians and the rich man is unsaved (<span class="scripRef">Luke 16:25</span>).
That hope is not to be despised, but James is not
content to spare the rich now while they inflict such wrongs
on men whom they employ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.&rdquo;
We have here a hard phrase to understand. Homer uses the
verb meaning to turn milk into cheese (<i>Od.</i> ix. 246). But we
cannot feel sure (cf. <span class="scripRef">Luke 21:34</span>). And what is &ldquo;the day of
slaughter&rdquo;? Moffatt boldly renders it thus: &ldquo;You have fattened
yourselves as for the Day of Slaughter.&rdquo; That is at least
comprehensible. At any rate, when Jerusalem was destroyed,
the Romans slew the rich Jews indiscriminately, whether
they remained in the city or flew in despair to the Romans
who were bent on plunder (cf. Josephus, <i>War</i>, v. 10, 2). The
pious poor in all the ages have suffered at the hands of the
rich and the mighty. Even in America religious liberty came
as the result of fierce struggle. Political freedom was bought
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
with the price of blood. Economic justice will be won only
by tears and blood.</p>
<p>The very limit is reached. &ldquo;Ye have condemned, ye have
killed the righteous one; he doth not resist you.&rdquo; Many take
these words to refer to the death of Jesus as the culmination
of iniquity, when the rich Pharisees and Sadducees obtained
the death of the poor Carpenter of Nazareth. In these words
Peter charged that the Jews had been guilty of Christ&rsquo;s
death: &ldquo;But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and
asked for a murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the
Prince of life&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 3:14 f.</span>).</p>
<p>Certainly the application to Jesus has a deal of verisimilitude.
Stephen used similar language: &ldquo;And they killed them
that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of
whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Acts 7:52</span>).
&ldquo;The Righteous One&rdquo; is thus seen to be one of the titles
given Jesus by the early disciples. There is no reason why
James should not have referred to the death of Jesus in those
words.</p>
<p>But the book of Wisdom has similar language about the
righteous poor who are oppressed by the wicked rich, and
the parallel is so clear that probably James refers directly to
it. See <span class="scripRef">Wisdom 2:10 ff.</span>: &ldquo;Let us oppress the poor righteous
man; let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient
grey hairs of the aged.... Let us lie in wait for the
righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clear contrary
to our doings; he upbraideth us with our offending the
law.&rdquo; It was so in the days of the prophets. Hear Amos (<span class="scripRef">2:6 f.</span>)
as he thunders against the evils of his day: &ldquo;They
have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of
shoes&mdash;they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head
of the poor&rdquo; (surely the most greedy of men for real estate, if
they even seek that on top of the head of the poor!). The
picture is one of the oppression of the good man who is unresisting
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
and allows himself to be robbed. The horrors of
war to helpless women and children come before us.</p>
<p>It is curious that in the legendary account<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> of the death of
James, who was later called also &ldquo;the Just,&rdquo; we are told that
the Jews ran upon James, crying, &ldquo;Oh! oh! even the righteous
one.&rdquo; One of the priests vainly cried out: &ldquo;Stop! What are
you doing? The righteous one is praying for you.&rdquo; According
to this story, James himself finally met the very fate of those
unfortunate victims of Jewish greed and hate, of whom Jesus
is the chief illustration. Progress in behalf of human rights
is won only by slow advances here and there. But in the end
of the day the cause wins. The stars in their courses fight
against Sisera and all the enemies of man and God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c12">XII
<br />Perseverance and Prayer</h2>
<p>The purpose of James in writing his epistle comes out
clearly in <span class="scripRef">5:7-20</span>. He wishes to hearten the Jewish Christians
in the midst of their trials as well as to make a protest
against the oppressions to which they were subjected. &ldquo;The
storm of indignation is past, and from this point to the end
of the Epistle St. James writes in tones of tenderness and
affection&rdquo; (Plummer). He has denounced the persecutors
and now turns to the brethren who are under the heel of the
money devil.</p>
<h3>Patience till the Parousia (<span class="scripRef">5:7 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the
Lord.&rdquo; Moffatt has it &ldquo;till the arrival of the Lord.&rdquo; The example
of the righteous man, whether Christ or the typical
righteous poor man, argues strongly for long-suffering (&ldquo;long-tempered&rdquo;
like our &ldquo;sweet-tempered,&rdquo; &ldquo;quick-tempered,&rdquo;
and the opposite of &ldquo;short-tempered,&rdquo; according to Mayor).
In the Christian race one cannot afford to be short of wind.
He has a long run and must hold out until the goal is reached
(cf. <span class="scripRef">Heb. 12:1-3</span>).</p>
<p>One is reminded of the opening note of the Epistle of
James (<span class="scripRef">1:2-4</span>), where he urged joy in the midst of varied
trials. The wicked rich deserve all the fierce denunciation
that James has just bestowed and all the penalty that God will
inflict, but the suffering Christians must not engage in mere
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
recrimination. James does not discourage protest against
wrong or the effort to remove evil. But there is a residuum
of suffering and pain in the cup of all of us. When all else is
done, in the end of the day we must drink that cup. Let us do
it with the spirit of soldiers who fall in the trenches at the
post of duty. It is better to do it without flinching and without
making a wry face. God is full of long-suffering toward
us (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 2:4</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 3:20</span>), and men have shown the same
spirit (<span class="scripRef">James 5:10</span>; <span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 6:6</span>). The patience in <span class="scripRef">James 1:3 f.</span>
is just &ldquo;remaining under,&rdquo; but here the point is to do it and
make no fuss about it, not to call attention to what one is
suffering, to be a martyr without insisting on being recognized
as one.</p>
<p>The early Christians were so eager for the second coming
of the Lord Jesus that they were impatient for his return and
some of them completely upset about it, although Jesus had
emphasized the utter uncertainty of the time and had
urged watchfulness and readiness. By a skilful turn (Plummer)
James &ldquo;makes the unconscious impatience of primitive
Christianity a basis for his exhortation to conscious patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of them no longer had a taste for the slow work of
plowing, sowing, and reaping, forgetting what Jesus had
said of the gradual growth of the kingdom of God from seed
to harvest. So James, probably with the words of Jesus in
mind, says, &ldquo;Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious
fruit of the earth.&rdquo; The farmer, tiller of the soil, has
much to discourage him in the making and selling of his
crops. The soil has to be kept up to its level of fertility and
must be properly prepared. The seed must be of good quality
and has to be sown at the proper season. The weeds will
come, and the harvest is dependent on the sun and the
rain. He cannot hasten the process. When he has done the
most scientific farming, he can only wait in expectancy.
Often, perhaps daily, the farmer watches the growth of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
grain, &ldquo;being patient over it,&rdquo; bending over it as a fond
father. He knows that he cannot hasten the season. The early
rain made possible the sowing of the seed. The latter rain
will make possible a harvest. Meanwhile, he can do nothing
but wait &ldquo;until it receive&rdquo; the final touch from God&rsquo;s
hand. By force of circumstances the farmer has to exercise
long-suffering toward his crop of wheat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye also patient.&rdquo; James applies his illustration with
directness and power. &ldquo;Ye also,&rdquo; as well as the husbandman.
He does it, for nature has taught him her secrets. &ldquo;Ye&rdquo; should
do so, for Jesus has shown you the way. &ldquo;Establish your
hearts.&rdquo; Peter is charged with just this task when he has
turned (<span class="scripRef">Luke 22:32</span>). God strengthens us (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 5:10</span>;
<span class="scripRef">1 Thess. 3:13</span>), but we must do our share. &ldquo;For the coming of
the Lord is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;is at hand&rdquo; is the one that John the Baptist
used of the nearness of the kingdom of heaven which had
come right upon them (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 3:2</span>). So Peter (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 4:7</span>)
says, &ldquo;The end of all things is at hand.&rdquo; Paul (<span class="scripRef">Phil. 4:5</span>) says,
&ldquo;The Lord is at hand.&rdquo; There is no doubt that the early Christians
hoped that Jesus would come back quickly and thus relieve
them from the ills of an impossible social system (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 13:11</span>;
<span class="scripRef">1 Thess. 4:15</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 John 2:18</span>). But they did not at all
feel sure that Jesus was coming right away (<span class="scripRef">1 Thess. 5:2</span>;
<span class="scripRef">2 Thess. 3:1 ff.</span>; <span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 5:1-10</span>; <span class="scripRef">Phil. 1:21-23</span>).</p>
<p>When 2 Peter was written, scoffers were already asking,
&ldquo;Where is the promise of his coming?&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2 Peter 3:4</span>). The
answer is given that one day with the Lord is as a thousand
years and a thousand years as one day. Back to their tasks
they must go, back to the building up of the kingdom of God
in the midst of a world of woe and sin, on with the conflict till
Jesus comes, on with the long siege against human greed
and inhumanity to man. Patience is the word&mdash;patience and
prayer, pluck and praise, power and peace in the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h3>Folly of Recrimination (<span class="scripRef">5:9</span>)</h3>
<p>If things do not go to suit us, the natural way is to blame
somebody else for what has befallen us. We generally exculpate
ourselves from all responsibility. A na&iuml;ve illustration of
this propensity is found in <span class="scripRef">John 12:19</span>: &ldquo;Behold how ye prevail
nothing; lo, the world is gone after him.&rdquo; At the triumphal
entry of Jesus into Jerusalem the Pharisees, thinking
that their cause against Jesus was lost, turned and blamed
each other for the outcome. So then &ldquo;murmur not, brethren,
one against another.&rdquo; Literally it is, &ldquo;groan not, brothers,
against one another.&rdquo; See <span class="scripRef">Romans 8:23</span>: &ldquo;We ourselves groan
within ourselves.&rdquo; It is the inward and unexpressed feeling
rather than the outward expression of dissatisfaction (cf.
<span class="scripRef">James 4:11</span>).</p>
<p>The secret grudge is taken out in groans and murmurs. In
<span class="scripRef">Mark 7:34</span> Jesus is said to have groaned as he looked up to
heaven and prayed, perhaps out of sheer weariness at the
burden of sin and sorrow that was upon him. It is hard to
be content and to smother resentment at known or suspected
wrong. The suppressed volcano may easily break out into a
violent eruption. &ldquo;Let them wander up and down for meat,
and grudge if they be not satisfied&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 59:15, AV</span>). The
murmur of a mob is often senseless, and in all events we
must bear in mind that we bring down condemnation on our
own heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ye be not judged,&rdquo; says James. He recurs to this
point in <span class="scripRef">5:12</span>. Probably the words of Jesus in <span class="scripRef">Matthew 7:1</span>
are recalled by James. &ldquo;Behold, the judge standeth before the
door.&rdquo; He will hear all complaints and set everything right.
The picture appears to be that in the Mishnah <i>Ab.</i> iv. 16:
&ldquo;This world is as if it were a vestibule to the future world;
prepare thyself in the vestibule, that thou mayest enter the
reception room.&rdquo; Jesus is the Judge who stands at the door
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
through which all must pass. The conception is eschatological
and apocalyptic. See <span class="scripRef">Matthew 24:33</span>: &ldquo;Know ye that he is
nigh, even at the doors.&rdquo; In <span class="scripRef">Revelation 3:20</span> Jesus is represented
as saying: &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock.&rdquo;
Let him in now, that you and he may sup together. Let him
in now, else you may stand before him hereafter as culprit
and helpless and hopeless. &ldquo;Kiss the son, lest he be angry,
and ye perish in the way&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">Psalm 2:12</span>). Treat kindly one
another so that you will not need the Son to act as Judge between
you.</p>
<h3>Examples of Patience (<span class="scripRef">5:10 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>James, like a practical preacher, loves to illustrate his
points. He has a fitting one at hand in &ldquo;the prophets who
spake in the name of the Lord.&rdquo; They spoke in the name, with
the authority and with the power of the Lord. The idiom is
common enough in the Septuagint and, indeed, in the
papyri.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> They spoke as the representatives of Jehovah.
Mayor seems a bit perplexed over the failure of James to mention
Jesus as the supreme example of suffering, as is done by
Peter (<span class="scripRef">1 Peter 2:21</span>), who spoke of Christ&rsquo;s leaving us an
example, by Paul (<span class="scripRef">Phil. 2:5-11</span>), and by the author of Hebrews
(<span class="scripRef">12:1-5</span>).</p>
<p>Perhaps James may have thought it was particularly pertinent
for these Jewish Christians to be reminded of the
prophets as an &ldquo;example of suffering and of patience.&rdquo; Certainly
they endured evil in abundance and had great need
of long-suffering. It was common enough to appeal to them
for this purpose. Jesus did it with keenest irony at the mock
heroic monuments built later to the memory of the martyred
prophets (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:12; 23:34, 37</span>). Stephen did it with so
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
sharp a tongue that the Sanhedrin stoned him to death for
his courage and proved the truth of his words by their own
acts (<span class="scripRef">Acts 7:52</span>). Elijah says to Jehovah, &ldquo;The children of
Israel have ... slain thy prophets with the sword&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">1 Kings 19:10, 14</span>).
Jeremiah says also, &ldquo;Your own sword hath devoured
your prophets, like a destroying lion&rdquo; (<span class="scripRef">2:30</span>). As patterns
of patience take Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Isaiah,
and Jeremiah. These illustrate in various ways the patience
of which the readers of the Epistle of James stand in sore
need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, we call them blessed that endured.&rdquo; He had already
done that in <span class="scripRef">James 1:12</span>. Jesus had promised salvation
to the one who endured to the end (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 24:13</span>). Men usually
felicitate the survivors of a catastrophe. Often they become
popular heroes.</p>
<p>In particular, &ldquo;ye have heard of the patience of Job.&rdquo; Job
was the most frequently quoted instance in Old Testament
times and is a perfectly obvious one for James. And yet Job
did have passionate outbursts of indignation at the gibes and
superfluous advice of his tormenting friends, and even of
his wife, when God seemed to have deserted him. But it
must be remembered that Job did not curse God and die. He
waited for God to speak and make it all plain. Job hardly
exhibited long-suffering, but he clearly did show patience.
He was not exactly meek, but he revealed the endurance of a
sensitive man. Although Job is the most famous instance of
patience in the Old Testament, yet he is nowhere else cited
as such in the New Testament. We need not discuss the
question whether Job is parable or fact, as the point is here
precisely the same.</p>
<p>Ye &ldquo;have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is
full of pity, and merciful.&rdquo; The outcome in the case of Job
proves the point. It turned out all right with Job. So he illustrates
the pity and mercy of the Lord; &ldquo;the end of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
Lord&rdquo; is seen in the conclusion, like a novel that turns out
happily at last. In the midst of the stress and storm of Job&rsquo;s
life and his violent outbursts of emotion and exalted feeling
God is sympathetic and compassionate. God has understood
Job and watched his endurance all the while. The story is so
well known that James does not have to tell it but can depend
upon his readers to see the point of the illustration.</p>
<h3>Profanity (<span class="scripRef">5:12</span>)</h3>
<p>This little paragraph seems to come in rather abruptly,
with no connection with what precedes. As a result, Oesterley
regards it as &ldquo;a fragment of a larger piece&rdquo; which James here
tears from its context, perhaps a saying from Jesus. But
Plummer is more likely correct in thinking of it as an appendix
after rounding out the epistle, coming back to the
blessedness of trial, with which topic the epistle opens.</p>
<p>The exhortations need not have a close connection with
each other. As a matter of fact, James has spoken more
against the sins of speech than any other single sin. Plummer
well says, &ldquo;He has spoken against talkativeness, unrestrained
speaking, love of correcting others, railing, cursing, boasting,
murmuring&rdquo; (see <span class="scripRef">1:19, 26; 3:1-12; 4:11, 13; 5:9</span>). He now
recurs to the sins of speech to say a few words against one of
the commonest evils of which he has not spoken specifically.
He evidently is thinking of the words of Jesus as we have
them in <span class="scripRef">Matthew 5:34-37</span>, though it is not an exact quotation.<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a>
He may, indeed, as Resch holds, give another version
of the same logion (cf. <span class="scripRef">2 Cor. 1:17</span>). But there was ample
ground for this prohibition, as the Jews had learned how to
split hairs on the subject of profanity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The Third Commandment was plain enough on the subject,
and it was supported by the Pharisees and the Essenes.
The Essenes, indeed, opposed all oaths, even before courts,
and were said to have been excused by Herod from taking
the oath of allegiance (Jos., <i>Ant.</i> xv. 10.4). And yet, as Mayor
notes, this is not consistent with the oath of initiation which
the Essenes took (Jos., <i>War</i> ii. 8.7). The Jewish view is well
represented by <span class="scripRef">Sirach 23:7-11</span> and by Philo (M. 2, p. 184).</p>
<p>The early Christians found trouble with this verse of
James, as with the words of Jesus on the same point. See the
list of quotations from the early writers in Mayor. Augustine
sees no harm in oaths before courts if it were not for the danger
of committing perjury. And yet it may be seriously questioned
if Jesus or James is thinking of oaths in courts of justice,
since Jesus himself did not refuse to answer when put
on oath by the high priest before the Sanhedrin (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 26: 63 f.</span>).
Besides, solemn asseveration is allowed in the Old
Testament (<span class="scripRef">Deut. 6:13; 10:20</span>; <span class="scripRef">Isa. 65:16</span>). It is far more
likely the flippant use of oaths (profanity) that is here condemned.
There were, and are still, all sorts of devices by
which more or less pious people feel justified in calling on
the name of the Lord in ordinary speech. It is today one of
the saddest things in life to note how common profanity is in
the ordinary speech of men and of boys, mannish boys who
imitate the men about them. It is positively disheartening to
hear it on the streets, in the streetcars, in the trains.</p>
<p>If one is puzzled, as was Augustine, over the words &ldquo;above
all things,&rdquo; on the ground that profanity is not worse than
adultery and murder, we may take it either as a kind of
hyperbole (as did Augustine) or as a sort of elative superlative
(not literally <i>before</i> all but only very important), as
limited to the forms of impatience in the preceding context,
like <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 4:8</span>, where the same idiom occurs (Mayor).
But if the strict interpretation be insisted on, one has only to
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
consider what the sin of profanity really is. It is a blasphemous
use of the name of the Most High God. The fact that
it is usually done without thinking mitigates the offense, but
sometimes the full bitterness of profanity is meant. Few
things are worse than sulfurous speech like the very fumes of
hell. For my part, I should not press the words &ldquo;above all
things&rdquo; too far in this context.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by
any other oath.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> Certainly this is plain enough to be understood.
It is conclusive and inclusive and leaves no room
for the milder forms of profanity for which Christians sometimes
excuse themselves. &ldquo;But let your yea be yea; and your
nay, nay;&rdquo; &ldquo;let your &lsquo;yes&rsquo; be a plain &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; your &lsquo;no&rsquo; a plain
&lsquo;no&rsquo;&rdquo; (Moffatt)&mdash;this, and nothing more. But there is the
trouble. The need for emphasis and the love of strong assertion
lead a person so easily to go beyond the bounds of good
taste and decency. Edersheim (i. p. 583) has a Midrash quotation:
&ldquo;The good man&rsquo;s yea is yea, and his nay nay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In calmer moments one knows that the value of his statement
rests essentially on his own character for veracity. His
mere word is enough and, in truth, all that one can offer.
Violent expletives throw discredit on a person&rsquo;s ordinary
statements and suspicion on the one that he seeks to bolster
up with artificial means. Profanity is one of the worst and
most useless of sins. It brings good to none and harm to all,
in particular to the one who uses it. &ldquo;That ye fall not under
judgment.&rdquo; The Judge is at the door (<span class="scripRef">James 5:9</span>), and there
is no escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h3>Worship and Excitement (<span class="scripRef">5:13</span>)</h3>
<p>Plummer has a very keen and pertinent heading for his
chapter on this verse, and it is noteworthy that he devotes an
entire chapter to this one verse, a verse that is little understood
by most interpreters. His heading is this: &ldquo;Worship the
Best Outlet and Remedy for Excitement. The Connection between
Worship and Conduct.&rdquo; Certainly oaths are not the
way to express one&rsquo;s emotions, whether one be angry or
merely excited, least of all when one has the miserable habit
of profanity and is unaware of his foul speech. And yet it is
not wrong to express one&rsquo;s feelings. There is no merit in the
self-repression of the cynic or the stoic. &ldquo;Let the expression
of strongly excited feelings be an act of worship&rdquo; (Plummer).
This is an intensely practical point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is any among you suffering?&rdquo; And what church or community
does not have one or more of these occasional or
chronic sufferers? The word has a wider meaning than mere
bodily sickness. Paul uses it for suffering hardship as a good
soldier (<span class="scripRef">2 Tim. 2:3, 9; 4:5</span>). It includes any kind of ill of
body or mind. It means, literally, having hard experiences,
and it refers to natural depression as a result of such misfortunes.
The remedy is not in despondency or in suicide.
The remedy lies in prayer. &ldquo;Let him pray,&rdquo; let him pray as a
habit (present tense of durative action). Prayer is a blessing
to the heart and to the mental life. It is good to talk with
God. The worry disappears in God&rsquo;s presence and often the
very ill itself disappears. But if it does not go, he gives grace
sufficient to bear the burden. So then prayer is the proper outlet
for the depressed Christian.</p>
<p>Here lies one of the great blessings of public worship in the
house of God. The tired soul finds rest in prayer in the house
of prayer. There is comfort in secret prayer and in family
worship, but the man makes a tremendous psychological
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
blunder who cuts himself off from the spiritual tonic of the
public worship of God. Those in charge of that worship
should never fail to have in mind such persons who come to
church seeking comfort and strength.</p>
<p>But some hearts are overjoyed and feel like giving expression
to their joy in unusual ways, almost in ecstasy. &ldquo;Is any
cheerful?&rdquo; There are many in happy mood, in good spirits
or &ldquo;good cheer&rdquo; (cf. <span class="scripRef">Acts 27:22, 25</span>). These are in good
health of soul and perhaps also of body. &ldquo;Let him sing
praise.&rdquo; The word originally meant to play on a stringed instrument
(<span class="scripRef">Sir. 9:4</span>), but it comes to be used also for singing
with the voice and the heart (<span class="scripRef">Eph. 5:19</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 14:15</span>),
making melody with the heart to the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a wondrous exaltation of soul in the public praise
of God. The combination of instruments and of voice enables
the soul of man to pour itself out toward God in richness
of praise. This is far better than the reckless, unrestrained
ecstasy of overwrought emotionalism. Plummer
notes properly that there is no merit or demerit per se in excitement.
The wild dervish commands only astonishment,
not sympathy. Religious excitement may become the occasion
of bringing discredit upon Christianity, even when it
represents real fervor and an element of worship. The spirit
of man cannot always be restrained. Under the preaching of
Wesley and Whitefield the audiences were sometimes carried
to excesses of emotion. But far better this than the deadness
and coldness of mere formalism. Revivals occasionally
have been marked by such excesses, like the &ldquo;Jerks&rdquo; in Kentucky
one hundred and fifty years ago when, however, real
change of life took place.</p>
<p>There is wisdom in the words of James here. Let the religious
emotions find expression in prayer and praise. The
effect is not only good for the moment but is good for conduct
and life as a whole. If we could only manage somehow
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
to turn some of the energy that goes into our activities into
religious worship, certainly the effect would be more wholesome
all around. People cannot help a measure of excitement.
Some of it is good for them. There is tonic in communion
with God, tonic for soul and body.</p>
<h3>God and Medicine (<span class="scripRef">5:14-18</span>)</h3>
<p>Few subjects have excited more interest in recent years
than the subject here presented. So many subsidiary issues
are raised that it is difficult to treat the question adequately
in a few pages.</p>
<p>Many varieties of &ldquo;faith cures&rdquo; have been before the world.
The so-called Christian Science movement is now the most
prominent of them all, combining an idealistic philosophy
and pantheistic religion. This combination takes up various
aspects of Buddhism, Gnosticism, and a dash of Christian
verbiage with the vital elements of Christianity gone, and
uses some of the well-known ideas of modern psychology as to
the influence of the mind on the body. As a whole, it is a
hopeless jumble of absurdities and inconsistencies and is
hostile to the worship of Jesus. It leads astray a certain type
of mind without clear reasoning processes and fattens on the
fees for mental healing, a portion of which goes to the mother
church in Boston. There is only the most superficial parallel
between what James here describes and what the Christian
Science &ldquo;healer&rdquo; practices.</p>
<p>There is in James an absence of all mercenary ideas. There
is no &ldquo;commercialized use of prayer,&rdquo; to use the legal phrase
of one of the New York courts. There is also the use of olive
oil, the best medicine known to the ancient world and still
one of the best remedial agencies, whether used internally
or externally. The disciples of Jesus on their tour of Galilee
had the double ministry of preaching and healing (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 10:7 f.</span>),
and they anointed the sick with oil (<span class="scripRef">Mark 6:13</span>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
In <span class="scripRef">Isaiah 1:6</span> the prophet says that the bruises were &ldquo;neither
bound up, neither mollified with oil.&rdquo; So the good Samaritan
bound up the wounds of the poor victim of the robbers and
poured oil and wine upon him (<span class="scripRef">Luke 10:34</span>).</p>
<p>A number of questions come bristling for discussion as we
proceed with this passage in James. The use of the word
&ldquo;church&rdquo; rather than synagogue, as in <span class="scripRef">2:2</span>, is to be observed.
The local church undoubtedly had a close kinship to the
Jewish synagogue in origin and worship. The very phrase
&ldquo;elders of the church&rdquo; occurs also in <span class="scripRef">Acts 20:17</span> and in the
plural, like bishops at Philippi (<span class="scripRef">Phil. 1:1</span>). There was a council
of elders in the synagogue (<span class="scripRef">Luke 7:3</span>), and the word appears
in an official sense in the Egyptian papyri.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a></p>
<p>But a more vital question for our subject is whether these
elders come in an official capacity to perform an ecclesiastical
&ldquo;anointing&rdquo; with oil or whether they come to pray as brothers
in Christ and rub with the olive oil (cf. <span class="scripRef">Isa. 1:6</span>) as medicine.
Mayor quotes Philo (<i>Sonm</i>, M. i. 666), Pliny (N. H.
xxiii. 34-50), and Galen (<i>Med. Temp.</i>, book ii) in praise of
oil as a medicine. In Herod&rsquo;s last illness a bath of oil was
recommended to him (Jos., <i>War</i> i. 33, 5).</p>
<p>There is, therefore, no doubt as to the ancient opinion
about, and use of, oil as a medicine. It is probable that each
one will decide this question according to his predilections.
For my own part, I incline to the view that we have here not
a sacramental or priestly function on the part of these
elders but the double duty of ministry of the word and of
medicine (with prayer). The nearest parallel in modern life
is the medical missionary, who goes with the word of life and
the healing balm of modern science. He heals the sick with
the physician&rsquo;s skill and the prayer of faith. Paul helped the
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
sick (<span class="scripRef">Acts 20:35</span>) at Ephesus and often healed the sick, and
yet he worked side by side with Luke, the beloved physician,
as in the island of Melita (<span class="scripRef">Acts 28:8 f.</span>).</p>
<p>There is certainly no indication that what is called &ldquo;extreme
unction&rdquo; was practiced or urged by James and the
apostolic Christians. That was a later development in
Greek and Roman Catholic churches that is foreign to the
tone of this epistle. There is here no such superstition as
sending for a minister when death is at hand to perform a
magical ritual ceremony to stave off death. Mayor has a full
statement of the chief facts about the sacrament of unction
in later centuries. He suggests that the cases of the failure of
the simple use of oil as a medicine probably led finally to the
special consecration of the oil or the use of relics. But in
James we seem to have not a ceremony or ecclesiastical function
but rather the simple use of oil as a medicine and prayer
&ldquo;in the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today we have a more advanced medical science which
is, however, by no means final and infallible. We separate
the functions of the minister and the physician. We prefer
the doctor to the oil, but we still need God with the doctor. It
is a great error for one to think that God is not to be called
upon because we have a skilled physician. The minister still
has a place, and a very important place, in the problem of
therapeutics, particularly in those many cases of a more or
less nervous type when the influence of the mind on the body
is very pronounced. Often in the most severe illness the
deciding factor is not medicine but hope, as any doctor will
say. The minister should make friends with the physician and
be at his service and co-operate with him. The minister needs
to be careful to be a help and not a hindrance in cases of
sickness. He should be a sedative and an inspiration to the
patient, not an irritant or an excitant. It is a just ground of
complaint that physicians have against those preachers who
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
lend themselves to the schemes of quack doctors with patent
medicines for all sorts of ills.</p>
<p>But coming back to the use of prayer, James says, &ldquo;And
the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord
shall raise him up.&rdquo; The credit is here given to prayer and the
power of God. One is not to infer that James gives no credit
to medicine. The oil was good; God works through medicine
and without medicine. The best that we still know on this
subject is this: prayer and medicine, or God and the doctor.
The promise of James may be compared with those of Jesus
in <span class="scripRef">Mark 11:24</span> and <span class="scripRef">John 14:14</span>. But the very essence of
prayer is acquiescence with us. By &ldquo;save&rdquo; here James means
&ldquo;cure,&rdquo; as it often does in the Gospels (<span class="scripRef">Mark 5:23; 6:56; 8:35</span>).</p>
<p>The prayer of faith is the only kind that is real prayer, and
it is trust in God with full acknowledgment of God&rsquo;s power
and love. Some men have always had the idea of a God so
aloof from the world that he cares nothing about it or is
powerless to help. There is nothing in modern scientific
knowledge inconsistent with an immanent, yet transcendent,
God who holds the key of life in himself. The wondrous laws
of nature are all of God, and there are many more that we
do not yet understand. Science has vastly increased our
sense of wonder about God and his world. We have only
skirted the fringes of knowledge. It is idle to say that God,
if he really sent his Son to redeem men from sin and all
earthly woe, does not care if we suffer in body and mind.
The Father&rsquo;s hand rests upon us all. He can be reached. He
is not far from any of us, and he loves us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him,&rdquo;
not by being healed in body nor because he is healed of his
sickness. The two things do not correspond, nor does one
follow because of the other. What James means, undoubtedly,
is that the cured man, convicted of his sins and out of
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
gratitude to God for his goodness, repents of his sins and is
forgiven.</p>
<p>This is what should always happen in such cases, but often
it occurs that men who profess repentance on a bed of sickness
forget it when they get up. This is sheer ingratitude and
a horrible outcome. But certainly if the sick man is a sinner,
he should be prayed for. It is the time of opportunity to get
him to listen to the voice of God. No undue advantage need
be taken of one&rsquo;s situation, and yet it is wise to speak plainly
then. Sickness is a great leveler and brings us all down. Beyond
any doubt, Roman Catholics have made good use of
their asylums and hospitals. Other denominations are beginning
to take a real interest in this aspect of Christian activity.
In the hour of sickness it is a great mercy to fall into the
hands of those who love God and where the love of Jesus is
mingled with the highest medical science.</p>
<p>During sickness is a good time to confess our sins to one
another as well as to God. &ldquo;Confess therefore your sins one
to another.&rdquo; Clearly if the sick man, conscious now of his own
weakness, is not willing to confess his sins against others, God
will not forgive him.</p>
<p>As Mayor points out, James expands the words of Jesus
about forgiving those who have trespassed against us (<span class="scripRef">Matt. 5:23 f.; 6:14</span>),
so as to bring out both sides of the subject.
Let the sick man ask forgiveness of those whom he has
wronged. Then let them forgive him and pray for him. &ldquo;Pray
one for another.&rdquo; The Roman Catholics&mdash;Bellarmine, for instance&mdash;sometimes
appeal to this passage as a justification
for auricular confession to the priest; but Luther has a
pointed answer: &ldquo;A strange confessor. His name is &lsquo;One Another.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Cajetan &ldquo;speaks the language of common sense&rdquo;
(Mayor) and admits that James has no such custom in mind.
What James urges is public confession, in particular to those
wronged, not private and secret confession to a priest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The Roman Catholic confessional is one of the most dangerous
of ecclesiastical institutions. It puts untold power for
harm into the hands of the priest. It is difficult to conceive
how a husband or father could be willing for wife or daughter
to make secret confession to a priest. The abuses of the
confessional make a horrible chapter in human history. Not
merely are things wrung out that should not be told, but evil
is suggested that would never be thought of. The original
form of absolution was &ldquo;precatory rather than declaratory&rdquo;
(Plummer).</p>
<p>But it is a great good to the soul to open the heart and
make a frank confession to the church or to the persons who
have been injured. Great sorrow would be avoided if men
would only have the manhood to do this thing. Tertullian
(On Penance viii) well says, &ldquo;Confession of sins lightens as
much as concealment aggravates them.&rdquo; Confession of sin
was one of the cardinal tenets in the preaching of John the
Baptist. The Romanists demanded penance for sins publicly
confessed, and private enmity (Plummer) took advantage of
it for purposes of revenge.</p>
<p>Then it is a good time to pray &ldquo;that ye may be healed.&rdquo;
Then the power of God is with men to heal both soul and
body. Many a revival has started in a church because those
who have been estranged have buried the hatchet and seen
eye to eye again. There is power in prayer when the soul is
open to God, as can be true only when hate disappears from
the heart. &ldquo;The supplication of a righteous man availeth
much in its working,&rdquo; &ldquo;the prayers of the righteous have a
powerful effect&rdquo; (Moffatt).</p>
<p>This short sentence is clearer in the Greek than in any of
the English renderings. Plummer suggests, &ldquo;Great is the
strength of a righteous man&rsquo;s supplication, in its earnestness.&rdquo;
The word for &ldquo;supplication&rdquo; is more specific than the usual
term and suggests a sense of need. But the crucial word is
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
the participle, which may be either middle or passive.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> Our
word &ldquo;energetic&rdquo; is derived from the verbal adjective. The
notion of energy is present, at any rate. The great word in
modern science is this very word &ldquo;energy,&rdquo; which is made
luminous by electricity and radium. The only prayer worthwhile
is one with energy in it, whether inwrought (taking
the participle as passive) by the Spirit of God or at work
(middle voice) through the spiritual passion of the man&rsquo;s
own soul. Such a prayer has much force in it and is not a mere
ceremony or rattle of meaningless words.</p>
<p>The emphasis on &ldquo;a righteous man&rdquo; here does not mean
that God will not hear the cry of a sinner for mercy but probably
that a righteous man is more likely to put the proper
energy into his prayer. We may reflect sadly that our prayers
often have no power with God because they have no energy
when said. There is no power in the dynamo; the engine has
gone dead; the steam is not high enough to move the driving
wheel. Oesterley quotes aptly the words of Rabbi Ben Zakkai
in <i>Berachoth</i>, 34<i>b</i>, when prayers for a sick child are desired:
&ldquo;Although I am greater in learning than Chaninah, he is
more efficacious in prayer; I am indeed the Prince, but he is
the Steward who has constant access to the King.&rdquo; They
have it because they live close to God. With a great price
they have won this high prerogative. Ofttimes they are
the humblest of men in earthly station and store. Very mechanical,
surely, is the idea of Rabbi Isaac (<i>Jebamoth</i>, 64<i>a</i>),
who says: &ldquo;The prayer of the righteous is comparable to a
pitchfork; as the pitchfork changes the position of the wheat
so the prayer changes the disposition of God from wrath to
mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James has a typical case to illustrate his point. &ldquo;Elijah was
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
a man of like passions with us,&rdquo; &ldquo;with a nature just like our
own&rdquo; (Moffatt). James emphasizes the human frailties of
Elijah to show that he does not refer to ceremonial or sacramental
rites when he urges prayer for the sick. Such prayer
is the privilege not merely of the elders of the church but
of any good man who has the ear of God. That power is not
a function of ecclesiastical position but the reward of holy
living and trust in God. Elijah had his weaknesses as we all
have, but God heard him. The point for us is that if God
heard Elijah, he will hear any of us who puts the same
amount of spiritual energy into his prayer. &ldquo;He prayed fervently.&rdquo;
There is no use to pray in any other way. Elijah
prayed seven times before the rain came. Halfhearted prayer
defeats itself (cf. doubting prayer in <span class="scripRef">1:6 ff.</span>).</p>
<p>Many modern men have no faith in prayer of any kind
save as a wholesome reaction on the mind of the one who
prays. They scout the idea that the God of the universe would
condescend to listen to the feeble chatter of such worms in
the dust as men. They conceive it as impossible that God
would alter his will in any particular because of such insignificant
requests. Least of all do they admit the possibility
that God would change the weather in response to the prayer
of one or many individuals. They argue that the laws of the
weather are fixed by the laws of nature and that God does not
alter his own laws. A very pretty network of impossibilities
is fixed up, but all the same, the experience of Christians
breaks right through these entanglements.</p>
<p>A real God is greater than his own laws, and his own will
is the chief law of his nature. God is not an absentee God; he
is our Father and loves for us to tell him our troubles. Certainly
God knows how to work his own laws. We do not
have to think that Elijah had the matter of drought and rain
in his own hands at his beck and call. Far from it. Elijah
won by strenuous prayer and perseverance, not by lightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
informing God of his wishes. Besides, when rain came in
response to the prayer of Elijah, it came out of clouds, as rain
always does. God made the clouds gather from the west
(the Mediterranean) till the rain came. As the hot winds
from the east and the south brought the drought, so the west
winds brought rain. Many times in my own experience I
have known people to pray for rain, and the rain came. The
rain may not have come in response to the prayer; that I do
not know. But it came the very night in which prayer was
made for it at the prayer meeting. The difficulty in the matter
of rain is no greater than in cases of sickness. The root of the
trouble is the lack of trust in God, the broken relation with
God, the loss of power with him.</p>
<h3>Rescue Work or Restoring the Erring (<span class="scripRef">5:19 f.</span>)</h3>
<p>James makes a last appeal to his readers, and it has a touch
of tenderness&mdash;&ldquo;My brethren.&rdquo; In <span class="scripRef">verse 5</span> he spoke of the
case of a sick man who is brought to confess his sins and is
led to God. Here he seems to refer specifically to the case
of a brother who has fallen into error. There are such sad
instances that puzzle many a pastor by their indifference,
hardness, and even scorn of Christ. &ldquo;If any among you err
from the truth, and one convert him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The condition (third class) is put delicately only as a
supposed case, not assumed as true and yet probable, alas.
&ldquo;Err&rdquo; is from the Latin <i>errare</i> (to wander, to go astray). The
Greek word here suggests the picture of one who is lost in
the mountains, who has missed his path,<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a> without passing on
the question of his own part in the process. That is now
neither here nor there, for he is lost. Our &ldquo;planet&rdquo; is this
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
word, from the notion that these luminaries were wandering
stars, not fixed like the rest. We now know that none of the
stars are fixed, but they all move with great speed.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, it is not impossible for brethren to go
astray &ldquo;from the truth.&rdquo; One way to treat them is to kick
them out of the way, down the hill. Another way is to go
after them with hammer and tongs to beat them back into
the path. Another course is to give them up in disgust and
to wash our hands of all responsibility. It must be confessed
that often it is very hard to do anything else, since brethren
act with so much independence and resent any effort to
show them a better way. When they start away, often they
go the whole way. But there is a more excellent way&mdash;the
way of love. See <span class="scripRef">1 Corinthians 13</span> and <span class="scripRef">Galatians 6:1 ff.</span></p>
<p>We are our brothers&rsquo; keepers in spite of all they say and all
that we may feel. You that are spiritual have a call to mind
the broken lives all about you. There is no nobler work than
this rescue work, to turn a sinner &ldquo;from the error of his
way.&rdquo; It is so hard to get a man back on the right track. He,
like all lost men, wanders round and round in his old tracks
of sin and error. He is the victim of his own logical fallacies
and sinful delusions. Though a giant, he is bound by the
cords of the Lilliputians, the bonds of habit which he does
not break.</p>
<p>It is enough to discourage any social worker in the slums
or in the tenement districts of our cities to see the hopeless
conditions in which the victims live. Drugs have fastened
some with clamps of steel; drink has fired the blood of others;
cigarettes have deadened the will of others; and immorality
has hurled still others into the pit. They stumble into the
rescue halls, &ldquo;cities of refuge&rdquo; in our cities. Happy are those
who know how to save souls like these who have known
better days and who have gone down into the valley of sin
and sorrow. But it is worthwhile to save souls like these for
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
whom Jesus died. Let the rescue worker know (by personal
experience, in truth) that he &ldquo;shall save a soul from death,&rdquo;
from a living death in which such a soul already finds itself
and from eternal death as well. That is the reward of the
winner of souls.</p>
<p>But it is not alone those who go down into the depths of
gross sin, the &ldquo;pick-me-ups&rdquo; of life, that are to be won back.
There are many who live in accord with the outward ethical
standards of life who turn away from the knowledge of
Jesus, who go after the strange gods of gold, of so-called
knowledge, of materialistic monism, of &ldquo;new thought,&rdquo; of
Christian Science, of Russellism, of any new fad in science
or philosophy or religion, of any new form of old wives&rsquo; fables
that lead men astray. These are, in reality, more difficult to
win back to the truth as it is in Jesus, for they have the pride
of knowledge and look with compassionate condescension on
those who still worship Jesus as God and Saviour from sin.</p>
<p>The worker for souls has one more joy. He learns to see
the good side of human nature. The bad side is there beyond
a shadow of doubt. No man knows that better than the
worker for the redemption of human souls. But this fact does
not make him a pessimist or a cynic. He sees the angel in
the stone. He learns the love that &ldquo;shall cover a multitude
of sins,&rdquo; &ldquo;hides a host of sins&rdquo; (Moffatt), that covers with
a veil the sins of the poor soul who wandered away and is
now brought back. See <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 4:8</span> for the same idea.</p>
<p>This is not the Jewish doctrine of merit in good works
balancing evil ones, as Oesterley holds. Mayor also thinks
that the man who rescues another saves his own soul. But this
interpretation seems out of harmony with the teaching of
Jesus and the whole trend of the gospel message. We do not
need to go back to these &ldquo;blind guides&rdquo; of Pharisaism to
find the key to this verse and that in <span class="scripRef">1 Peter 4:8</span>, where we
read that &ldquo;love covers a multitude of sins.&rdquo; It is the love
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
that no longer sees the sins of the saved sinner. We see the
true idea in <span class="scripRef">Proverbs 10:12</span>: &ldquo;Hatred stirreth up strifes, but
love covereth all transgressions.&rdquo; See also <span class="scripRef">Psalm 85:2</span>: &ldquo;Thou
hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast covered
all their sin.&rdquo; In <span class="scripRef">Luke 7:47</span> Jesus speaks of the love of the
converted woman as proof that she has been forgiven much.</p>
<p>James presents the joy of the winner of souls who throws
the mantle of love over the sins of the repentant sinner, the
joy of the Shepherd who has found the lost sheep out on the
mountain and is returning with him in his arms, the joy of
the Father who welcomes the prodigal boy home with the
best robe and the fatted calf, the joy in the presence of the
angels that one sinner has repented and turned unto God.
That is heaven on earth. The preacher who has missed this
joy of winning souls has missed the greatest reward in his
ministry. If he has this, he can do without much else. He
can stand many rebuffs, small salary, lack of help, if only
there is this meat to eat that satisfied the soul of Jesus when
he led one poor abandoned woman into the light and life of
God.</p>

world are attractive to the right-minded man (<span class="scripRef">Rom. 1:20</span>). It is applied to
the people of the earth (<span class="scripRef">John 1:29</span>) and then to the believers who are
alienated from God (<span class="scripRef">John 8:23; 12:31</span>), to this world which the devil rules
(<span class="scripRef">John 14:30</span>; <span class="scripRef">1 John 5:19</span>), whose spirit is hostile to that of Christ (<span class="scripRef">1 Cor. 2:12</span>),
against which James has already (<span class="scripRef">1:25</span>) warned his readers.

the words of Jesus than all of Paul&rsquo;s epistles and that all of them deal with
the morality of the gospel, with conduct and life. This is all as the circumstances
would lead us to expect.

subjunctive implies that the thing was being done. That is probably true,
for church members have been known to be guilty of this sin. However, it is
possible for this tense to prohibit the habit rather than the single act. &ldquo;Keep

probably (Mayor) in <span class="scripRef">Luke 21:8</span>; <span class="scripRef">2 Peter 2:15</span>. The passive is constantly
making inroads on the middle in Koine Greek.
